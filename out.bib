  abstract = {In honor of Alan Turing's hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some
	thoughts about one of Turing's obsessions throughout his life, the
	question of physics and free will. I focus relatively narrowly on
	a notion that I call "Knightian freedom": a certain kind of in-principle
	physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability.
	Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as possibly
	outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
	by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries
	to find scope for "freedom" in the universe's boundary conditions
	rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously
	leads to many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how
	far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the way,
	encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
	problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle,
	Newcomb's paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory,
	and the Common Prior Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored
	here to the more radical speculations of Roger Penrose. The result
	of all this is an unusual perspective on time, quantum mechanics,
	and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which has
	several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
	empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and
	takes a millennia-old philosophical debate into some underexplored
	territory.},

  month = {9},
  note = {arXiv:1309.7460v2},
  abstract = {BosonSampling, which we proposed three years ago, is a scheme for
	using linear-optical networks to solve sampling problems that appear
	to be intractable for a classical computer. In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin
	et al. claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would
	be "operationally indistinguishable" from a uniform random outcome,
	at least "without detailed a priori knowledge"; or at any rate, that
	telling the two apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer
	these claims---explaining why the first is based on a definition
	of "a priori knowledge" so strange that, were it adopted, almost
	no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure random-number
	source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle
	to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further,
	and address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin
	et al.'s mistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability
	over a Haar-random matrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced
	by A is far from the uniform distribution in total variation distance.
	More surprisingly, and directly counter to Gogolin et al., we give
	an efficient algorithm that distinguishes these two distributions
	with constant bias. Finally, we offer three "bonus" results about
	BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando Brandao:
	that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy
	and that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by
	any circuit of fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling
	distributions can be efficiently distinguished from uniform even
	with photon losses and for general initial states. Third, we offer
	the simplest known proof that FermionSampling is solvable in classical
	polynomial time, and we reuse techniques from our BosonSampling analysis
	to characterize random FermionSampling distributions.},

	for the Permanent},
  journal = {arXiv:1212.0025v2},
  year = {2012},
  month = {11},
  note = {arXiv:1212.0025v2},
  abstract = {Around 2002, Leonid Gurvits gave a striking randomized algorithm to
	approximate the permanent of an n*n matrix A. The algorithm runs
	in O(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n
	additive error. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that
	it works for arbitrary matrices, not just for nonnegative matrices.
	This makes it highly relevant to quantum optics, where the permanents
	of bounded-norm complex matrices play a central role. Indeed, the
	existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their recent work on
	the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had to
	talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems. In
	this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using
	an idea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that
	it yields a better approximation when the matrix A has either repeated
	rows or repeated columns. Translating back to quantum optics, this
	lets us classically estimate the probability of any outcome of an
	AA-type experiment---even an outcome involving multiple photons "bunched"
	in the same mode---at least as well as that probability can be estimated
	by the experiment itself. (This does not, of course, let us solve
	the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper bound on
	the probabilities of "bunched" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture
	of Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest. Second,
	we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the
	special case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly,
	we generalize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers,
	construct "complex eps-biased sets," then use those sets to derandomize
	even our generalization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn
	case (again for nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be
	derandomized for general A remains an outstanding problem.},

	In quantum mechanics, observing is not a passive act. Consider a
	system of two quantum particles A and B: if a measurement apparatus
	M is used to make an observation on particle B, then the overall
	state of the system AB will typically be altered. When this happens
	no matter which local measurement is performed, the two objects A

	discord. Here we demonstrate that the very act of local observation
	gives rise to an "activation protocol" which converts discord into
	distillable entanglement, a stronger and more useful form of quantum
	correlations, between the apparatus M and the composite system AB.
	In order to experimentally implement such activation protocol, we
	adopt a flexible two-photon setup to realize a three-qubit system
	(A,B,M) with programmable degrees of initial correlations, measurement
	interaction, and characterization processes. Our experiment demonstrates
	the fundamental mechanism underpinning the ubiquitous act of observing

  abstract = {The study of Gaussian states has arisen to a privileged position in
	continuous variable quantum information in recent years. This is
	due to vehemently pursued experimental realisations and a magnificently
	elegant mathematical framework. In this article, we provide a brief,
	and hopefully didactic, exposition of Gaussian state quantum information
	and its contemporary uses, including sometimes omitted crucial details.
	After introducing the subject material and outlining the essential
	toolbox of continuous variable systems, we define the basic notions
	needed to understand Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. In
	particular, emphasis is placed on the mathematical structure combining
	notions of algebra and symplectic geometry fundamental to a complete
	understanding of Gaussian informatics. Furthermore, we discuss the
	quantification of different forms of correlations (including entanglement
	and quantum discord) for Gaussian states, paying special attention
	to recently developed measures. The manuscript is concluded by succinctly
	expressing the main Gaussian state limitations and outlining a selection
	of possible future lines for quantum information processing with
	continuous variable systems.},

  abstract = {Mochon's proof [Moc07] of existence of quantum weak coin flipping

	times as a black box in important follow-up results [Gan09, CK09,

	considerably, making about 20 pages of analysis in the original proof
	superfluous, clarifying some other parts of the proof on the way,
	and presenting the proof in a way which is conceptually easier to

	provide a definition together with a simplification, denoted sLTCs,
	for the special case of stabilizer codes, together with some basic
	results using those definitions. The most crucial parameter of such
	codes is their soundness, $R(\delta)$, namely, the probability that
	a randomly chosen constraint is violated as a function of the distance
	of a word from the code ($\delta$, the relative distance from the
	code, is called the proximity). We then proceed to study limitations
	on qLTCs. In our first main result we prove a surprising, inherently
	quantum, property of sLTCs: for small values of proximity, the better
	the small-set expansion of the interaction graph of the constraints,
	the less sound the qLTC becomes. This phenomenon, which can be attributed
	to monogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical
	setting. The complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an
	upper bound on the soundness when the code is defined on poor small-set
	expanders (a bound which turns out to be far more difficult to show
	in the quantum case). Together we arrive at a quantum upper-bound
	on the soundness of stabilizer qLTCs set on any graph, which does
	not hold in the classical case. Many open questions are raised regarding
	what possible parameters are achievable for qLTCs. In the appendix
	we also define a quantum analogue of PCPs of proximity (PCPPs) and
	point out that the result of Ben-Sasson et. al. by which PCPPs imply
	LTCs with related parameters, carries over to the sLTCs. This creates
	a first link between qLTCs and quantum PCPs.},

  abstract = {The local Hamiltonian problem is famously complete for the class QMA,
	the quantum analogue of NP. The complexity of its semi-classical
	version, in which the terms of the Hamiltonian are required to commute
	(the CLH problem), has attracted considerable attention recently
	due to its intriguing nature, as well as in relation to growing interest
	in the qPCP conjecture. We show here that if the underlying bipartite
	interaction graph of the CLH instance is a good locally-expanding
	graph, namely, the expansion of any constant-size set is e-close
	to optimal, then approximating its ground energy to within additive
	factor O(e) lies in NP. The proof holds for k- local Hamiltonians
	for any constant k and any constant dimensionality of particles d.
	We also show that the approximation problem of CLH on such good local
	expanders is NP-hard. This implies that too good local expansion
	of the interaction graph constitutes an obstacle against quantum
	hardness of the approximation problem, though it retains its classical
	hardness. The result highlights new difficulties in trying to mimic
	classical proofs (in particular Dinur's PCP proof) in an attempt
	to prove the quantum PCP conjecture. A related result was discovered
	recently independently by Brandao and Harrow, for 2-local general
	Hamiltonians, bounding the quantum hardness of the approximation
	problem on good expanders, though no NP-hardness is known in that

  abstract = {This work is concerned with determination of the steady-state structure
	of time-independent Lindblad master equations, especially those possessing
	more than one steady state. The approach here is to treat Lindblad
	systems as generalizations of unitary quantum mechanics, extending
	the intuition of symmetries and conserved quantities to the dissipative
	case. We combine and apply various results to obtain an exhaustive
	characterization of the infinite-time behavior of Lindblad evolution,
	including both the structure of the infinite-time density matrix
	and its dependence on initial conditions. As a consequence, sufficient
	conditions for determining the steady state of a Lindblad master
	equation are obtained. These conditions are knowledge of the initial
	state, a basis for the steady-state subspace, and all conserved quantities.
	We give examples of two-qubit dissipation and d-photon absorption
	where these quantities are determined analytically. The use of Lindblad
	operators to store and manipulate quantum information is discussed.},

	Analyzing effects that appear to be common to many of such theories,

  abstract = {A quantum algorithm is exact if, on any input data, it outputs the
	correct answer with certainty (probability 1). A key question is:
	how big is the advantage of exact quantum algorithms over their classical
	counterparts: deterministic algorithms. For total Boolean functions
	in the query model, the biggest known gap was just a factor of 2:
	PARITY of N inputs bits requires $N$ queries classically but can
	be computed with N/2 queries by an exact quantum algorithm. We present
	the first example of a Boolean function f(x_1, ..., x_N) for which
	exact quantum algorithms have superlinear advantage over the deterministic
	algorithms. Any deterministic algorithm that computes our function
	must use N queries but an exact quantum algorithm can compute it
	with O(N^{0.8675...}) queries.},

	quantum information theory: determining the largest eigenvalue of
	a sum of p random product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and
	p/d^k are fixed while d grows. When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law
	determines (up to small corrections) not only the largest eigenvalue

	and the spectral density in between. We use the method of moments
	to show that for k>1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately
	(1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the
	Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result
	to the random tensor case. Our bound on the largest eigenvalue has
	implications both for sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution

	Alice gets to know the eigen-decomposition of a quantum state $\rho$.
	Bob gets to know the eigen-decomposition of a quantum state $\sigma$.
	Both Alice and Bob know $ S(\rho || \sigma) = Tr \rho \log \rho -
	\rho \log \sigma$, the relative entropy between $\rho$ and $\sigma$
	and an error parameter $\epsilon$. Alice and Bob use shared entanglement
	and after communication of $O((S(\rho || \sigma) +1)/\epsilon^4)$
	bits from Alice to Bob, Bob ends up with a quantum state $\tilde{\rho}$
	such that $F(\rho, \tilde{\rho}) \geq 1 - \epsilon$, where $F(\cdot)$
	represents fidelity. This result can be considered as a non-commutative
	generalization of a result due to Braverman and Rao [2011] where
	they considered the special case when $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are classical

	proof of a direct-sum result for entanglement assisted quantum one-way
	communication complexity for all relations, which was first shown

	a new operational meaning to trace distance between quantum states

	of the classical correlated-sampling protocol, which is widely used,
	for example by Holenstein [2007] in his proof of a parallel-repetition
	theorem for two-player one-round games. Recently Dinur, Steurer and
	Vidick [2013] have shown another version of a quantum correlated
	sampling protocol different from our protocol, and used it in their

	in MBQC computation is driven by adaptive measurements on a large

	In this paper we combine MBQC on graph states with AQC and investigate
	how properties, such as computational depth, energy gap and Hamiltonian
	degree, translate into each other. Following an approach proposed
	by Bacon and Flammia, we show that any measurement-based quantum

	between computational depth and Hamiltonian degree, and clarify the
	effects of out-of-order measurements in the adiabatic computation.
	In the extreme case, we present a translation to AGQC where all computations
	can be carried out in constant time, at the expense of having high

	a lower bound on the cost of simulating large degree operators using

	measures (SIC-POVMs, or SICs for short) have been constructed in
	every dimension $\le 67$, a general existence proof remains elusive.
	The purpose of this paper is to show that the SIC-existence problem
	is equivalent to three other, on the face of it quite different problems.
	We hope that these reformulations of the problem will make it more
	tractable. We also believe that the fact that SICs have these connections
	to other areas of mathematics is of some intrinsic interest. Specifically,
	we reformulate the SIC problem in terms of (1) Lie Groups, (2) Lie
	Algebras and (3) Jordan Algebras (the second result being a greatly
	strengthened version of one previously obtained by Appleby, Flammia
	and Fuchs). The connection between these three reformulations is
	non-trivial: it is not easy to demonstrate their equivalence directly,
	without appealing to their common equivalence to SIC existence. In
	the course of our analysis we obtain a number of other results which
	may be of some independent interest.},

  abstract = {We give a new proof for the area law for general 1D gapped systems,
	which exponentially improves Hastings' famous result \cite{ref:Has07}.
	Specifically, we show that for a chain of d-dimensional spins, governed
	by a 1D local Hamiltonian with a spectral gap \eps>0, the entanglement
	entropy of the ground state with respect to any cut in the chain
	is upper bounded by $O{\frac{\log^3 d}{\eps}}$. Our approach uses
	the framework Arad et al to construct a Chebyshev-based AGSP (Approximate
	Ground Space Projection) with favorable factors. However, our construction
	uses the Hamiltonian directly, instead of using the Detectability
	lemma, which allows us to work with general (frustrated) Hamiltonians,
	as well as slightly improving the $1/\eps$ dependence of the bound
	in Arad et al. To achieve that, we establish a new, "random-walk
	like", bound on the entanglement rank of an arbitrary power of a
	1D Hamiltonian, which might be of independent interest: \ER{H^\ell}
	\le (\ell d)^{O(\sqrt{\ell})}. Finally, treating d as a constant,
	our AGSP shows that the ground state is well approximated by a matrix
	product state with a sublinear bond dimension $B=e^{O(\log^{3/4}n/\eps^{1/4})}.
	Using this in conjunction with known dynamical programing algorithms,
	yields an algorithm for a 1/\poly(n) approximation of the ground
	energy with a subexponential running time T\le \exp(e^{O(\log^{3/4}n/\eps^{1/4})}).},

	quantum state discrimination between r given states \sigma_1,...,\sigma_r.
	By splitting up the overall test into multiple binary tests in various
	ways we obtain a number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability
	in terms of the binary error probabilities. These upper bounds allow
	us to deduce various bounds on the asymptotic error rate, for which
	it has been hypothesised that it is given by the multi-hypothesis
	quantum Chernoff bound (or Chernoff divergence) C(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_r),
	as recently introduced by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a in analogy with
	Salikhov's classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This quantity
	is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences
	min_{j<k}C(\sigma_j,\sigma_k). It was known already that the optimal
	asymptotic rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain
	classes of sets of states the bound is actually achieved. It was
	known to be achieved, in particular, when the state pair that is
	closest together in Chernoff divergence is more than 6 times closer
	than the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in two ways.
	Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between
	C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved
	when the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the
	next closest pair. We also show that the Chernoff bound is achieved
	when at least $r-2$ of the states are pure, improving on a previous
	result by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a. Finally, we indicate a number of
	potential pathways along which a proof (or disproof) may eventually
	be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound is always
	achieved.},

  abstract = {In the task of quantum state exclusion we consider a quantum system,
	prepared in a state chosen from a known set. The aim is to perform
	a measurement on the system which can conclusively rule that a subset
	of the possible preparation procedures can not have taken place.
	We ask what conditions the set of states must obey in order for this
	to be possible and how well we can complete the task when it is not.
	The task of quantum state discrimination forms a subclass of this
	set of problems. Within this paper we formulate the general problem
	as a Semidefinite Program (SDP), enabling us to derive sufficient
	and necessary conditions for a measurement to be optimal. Furthermore,
	we obtain a necessary condition on the set of states for exclusion
	to be achievable with certainty. This task of conclusively excluding
	states has gained importance in the context of the foundations of
	quantum mechanics due to a result of Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR).
	Motivated by this, we use our SDP to derive a bound on how well a
	class of hidden variable models can perform at a particular task,
	proving an analogue of Tsirelson's bound for the PBR experiment and
	the optimality of a measurement given by PBR in the process. We also
	introduce variations of conclusive exclusion, including unambiguous
	state exclusion, and state exclusion with worst case error.},

  note = {arXiv:1306.2712v1},
  abstract = {One of the many interesting features of quantum nonlocality is that
	the states of a multipartite quantum system cannot always be distinguished
	as well by local measurements as they can when all quantum measurements
	are allowed. In this work, we characterize the distinguishability
	of sets of multipartite quantum states when restricted to separable
	measurements -- those which contain the class of local measurements
	but nevertheless are free of entanglement between the component systems.
	We consider two quantities: The separable fidelity -- a truly quantum
	quantity -- which measures how well we can "clone" the input state,
	and the classical probability of success, which simply gives the
	optimal probability in identifying the state correctly. We obtain
	lower and upper bounds on the separable fidelity and give several
	examples in the bipartite and multipartite settings where these bounds
	are optimal. Moreover the optimal values in these cases can be attained
	by local measurements. We further show that for distinguishing orthogonal
	states under separable measurements, a strategy that maximizes the
	probability of success is also optimal for separable fidelity. We
	point out that the equality of fidelity and success probability does
	not depend on an using optimal strategy, only on the orthogonality
	of the states. To illustrate this, we present an example where two
	sets (one consisting of orthogonal states, and the other non-orthogonal
	states) are shown to have the same separable fidelity even though
	the success probabilities are different.},

  abstract = {A quantum computer can solve hard problems - such as prime factoring,
	database searching, and quantum simulation - at the cost of needing
	to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction
	provides this protection, by distributing a logical state among many
	physical qubits via quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an
	appealing platform, as it allows for constructing large quantum circuits,
	and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits
	the surface code is a natural choice for error correction, as it
	uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly-cycled entangling
	gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The per-step fidelity
	threshold is only about 99%. Here, we demonstrate a universal set
	of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving
	an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92% and a two-qubit gate
	fidelity up to 99.4%. This places Josephson quantum computing at
	the fault-tolerant threshold for surface code error correction. Our
	quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using
	five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling.
	As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
	(GHZ) state using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The
	results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity
	technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant
	quantum circuits.},

	where $T$ is the temperature of a thermal reservoir used in the process
	and $k$ is Boltzmann's constant. Jaynes, however, argued that the

	quantities which would suggest that information erasure may have
	alternative costs. Indeed we showed recently that by using a reservoir
	comprising energy degenerate spins and subject to conservation of
	angular momentum, the cost of information erasure is in terms of
	angular momentum rather than energy. Here we extend this analysis
	and derive the minimum cost of information erasure for systems where
	different conservation laws operate. We find that, for each conserved
	quantity, the minimum resource needed to erase 1 bit of memory is
	$\lambda^{-1}\ln(2)$ where $\lambda$ is related to the average value

	if the distributions do not overlap, then the quantum state itself

	models in which the quantum overlap between pure states is equal

  abstract = {Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over
	their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable
	for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the
	concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions,
	among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified
	by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves.
	Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations.
	We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal
	quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum
	computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes
	the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the
	experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the
	verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit
	them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this
	protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can
	test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum
	computations.},

  abstract = {CHSH_q is the following simple two-player game: two parties are given
	x,y in F_q uniformly at random, and each must produce an output a,b
	in F_q without communicating with the other. The players objective
	is to maximize the probability that their outputs satisfy a+b=xy
	in F_q. This game was introduced by Buhrman and Massar (Phys. Rev.
	A 72.5 (2005)) as a large alphabet generalization of the CHSH game,
	which is one of the most well-studied games in quantum information
	theory, and which has large number of applications to quantum cryptography
	and quantum complexity. In this work, we obtain the first asymptotic
	results on the quantum and classical values of CHSH_q. The main result
	regarding the quantum value of CHSH_q is an upper bound of O(q^{-1/2}).
	Regarding the classical value of the game, we prove an upper bound
	O(q^{1/2-eps}) in the case of q=p^{2k-1}, and a tight lower bound
	of Omega(q^{-1/2}) for q=p^{2k}. A key observation that allows us
	to obtain the above bounds is a geometric view of CHSH_q which reveals
	an intimate connection between this game and the celebrated finite
	field Szemer\'{e}di-Trotter theorem of Bourgain-Katz-Tao (GAFA 14.1
	(2004)). This connection creates one of the first links between the
	study of multiplayer refereed games and arithmetic combinatorics,
	and may have applications to other areas. Beside the above, our work
	contains various other technical results of independent interest.
	For example, as an intermediate step in our quantum upper bound we
	prove a new variant of the principle of information causality, resolving
	an open problem of Pawlowski and Winter (Phys. Rev. A 85.2 (2012)).},

	In this paper, we develop a new non-Carath\'{e}odory-type tool for
	evaluating expressions involving a single quantum auxiliary register
	and several classical random variables. As we show, such expressions
	appear in problems of entanglement-assisted Gray-Wyner and entanglement-assisted
	channel simulation, where the question of whether entanglement helps
	in these settings is related to that of evaluating expressions with
	a single quantum auxiliary register. To evaluate such expressions,
	we argue that developing a quantum analog of the Carath\'{e}odory
	theorem requires a better understanding of a notion which we call
	``quantum conditioning." We then proceed by proving a few results
	about quantum conditioning, one of which is that quantum conditioning
	is strictly richer than the usual classical conditioning.},

	understanding of the theory of QMA-completeness is not as rich as
	its classical analogue, the NP- completeness. In this paper we consider
	the clique problem in graphs, which is NP- complete, and try to find
	its quantum analogue. We show that, quantum clique problem can be
	defined as follows; Given a quantum channel, decide whether there
	are k states that are distinguishable, with no error, after passing
	through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering the clique
	problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then redefining
	it in quantum information theory. We prove that, quantum clique problem
	is QMA-complete. In the second part of paper, we consider the same
	problem for the Holevo capacity. We prove that computing the Holevo
	capacity as well as the minimum entropy of a quantum channel is NP-complete.
	Also, we show these results hold even if the set of quantum channels

	(QFT) over G, together with gates which compute quadratic functions

	a nontrivial example of a family of quantum circuits that cannot

	and quantum correlations. We provide an information theoretic analysis

	In the third part, we discuss the concept of randomness extractors.
	Classical and quantum randomness are an essential resource in information
	theory, cryptography, and computation. However, most sources of randomness
	exhibit only weak forms of unpredictability, and the goal of randomness
	extraction is to convert such weak randomness into (almost) perfect

	Shannon's noisy channel theorem can be understood as the use of a
	noisy channel to simulate a noiseless one. Channel simulations as

	noisy channels from noiseless ones. Starting from the purely classical

  note = {arXiv:1403.6102v2},
  abstract = {The conditional quantum mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ of a tripartite
	state $\rho_{ABC}$ is an information quantity which lies at the center
	of many problems in quantum information theory. Three of its main
	properties are that it is non-negative for any tripartite state,
	that it decreases under local operations applied to systems $A$ and
	$B$, and that it obeys the duality relation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$ for
	a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. It has been an open question
	to find Renyi generalizations of the conditional mutual information,
	that would allow for a deeper understanding of the original quantity
	and find applications beyond the traditional memoryless setting of
	quantum information theory. The present paper addresses this question,
	by defining different $\alpha$-Renyi generalizations $I_{\alpha}(A;B|C)$
	of the conditional mutual information that all converge to the conditional
	mutual information in the limit $\alpha \to 1$. Furthermore, we prove
	that many of these generalizations satisfy the aforementioned properties.
	As such, the quantities defined here should find applications in
	quantum information theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics,

	illustrative applications to both closed- and open-system simulation

	using only local (one-body) controls. In particular, we provide simulation
	schemes applicable to Heisenberg-coupled spin chains exposed to general

	in quantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum
	de Finetti theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local
	measurements one can get a much improved error dependence on the
	dimension of the subsystems. We also obtain similar results for non-signaling
	probability distributions. We give the following applications of
	the results: We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol
	for 3-SAT, under the exponential time hypothesis. We show that the
	maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated in polynomial
	time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m variables
	can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the
	maximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m^{1/2})-player
	one-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m^{1/2})
	bits all together. We show that the optimization of certain polynomials
	over the hypersphere can be performed in quasipolynomial time in
	the number of variables n by considering O(log(n)) rounds of the
	Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of semidefinite programs.
	As an application to entanglement theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time
	algorithm for deciding multipartite separability. We consider a result
	due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit state one
	can perform tomography that works well for most observables by measuring
	only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies
	of the state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of
	the state to merely the ability to select subsystems at random from
	a quantum multipartite state. The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti
	theorems are based on information theory, in particular on the chain
	rule of mutual information.},

  abstract = {The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state
	energy (given by the minimum eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian.
	First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation
	for the ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more
	of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion,
	or (3) a ground state with sublinear entanglement with respect to
	some partition into small pieces. The approximation based on degree
	is a surprising difference between quantum Hamiltonians and classical
	CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems), since in the classical setting,
	higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs. The approximation
	based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only in
	the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence
	of a low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result implies
	that any Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have:
	(1) constant degree, (2) constant expansion, (3) a "volume law" for
	entanglement with respect to any partition into small parts. Second,
	we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations
	not only exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local
	Hamiltonians on any planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal,
	Bravyi, and Terhal, (2) dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant
	k, solving an open problem of Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local
	Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold rank, via a quantum generalization
	of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our work introduces
	two new tools which may be of independent interest. First, we prove
	a new quantum version of the de Finetti theorem which does not require
	the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to analyze
	the application of the Lasserre/Parrilo SDP hierarchy to local quantum
	Hamiltonians.},

  abstract = {We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed
	of polynomially many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate
	unitary poly(n)-design. Previously it was unknown whether random
	quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based
	on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation
	theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ
	a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of quantum
	local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation
	matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group
	the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks;
	and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups
	of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic
	entries, are infinity-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider
	pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of
	small depth and prove they constitute a quantum poly(n)-copy tensor-product
	expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body
	theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov et al.
	We give three applications of the results. First we show that almost
	every circuit U of size n^k on n qubits cannot be distinguished from
	a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size n^[(k+3)/6] that are given
	oracle access to U; this provides a data-hiding scheme against computationally
	bounded adversaries. Second we reconsider a recent argument of Masanes
	et al concerning local equilibration of time-evolving quantum systems,
	and strengthen the connection between fast equilibration of small
	subsystems and the circuit complexity of the Hamiltonian. Third we
	show that in one dimension almost every parallel local circuit of
	linear depth generates topological order, matching an upper bound
	to the problem due to Bravyi et al.},

	However, the existence of quantum data-hiding state--that is, states
	having very small correlations, yet a volume scaling of entanglement--was
	believed to be a serious obstruction to such an implication. Here
	we prove that notwithstanding the phenomenon of data hiding, one-dimensional

	that under very general conditions, observers who access a quantum

	We demonstrate that this emergence of classicality by observing parts
	of the environment, known as quantum Darwinism and studied before
	in a variety of particular situations, is a general feature of quantum

	is distributed to many parties, the minimal average loss in correlations
	is equal to the quantum discord. We obtain the results by further
	developing recent information-theoretic tools for analysing the distribution

  note = {arXiv:1404.6885v1},
  abstract = {Algorithmic cooling (AC) is a method to purify quantum systems, such
	as ensembles of nuclear spins, or cold atoms in an optical lattice.
	When applied to spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized
	spins, which enhance the signal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance
	(NMR). According to this cooling approach, spin-half nuclei in a
	constant magnetic field are considered as bits, or more precisely,
	quantum bits, in a known probability distribution. Algorithmic steps
	on these bits are then translated into specially designed NMR pulse
	sequences using common NMR quantum computation tools. The $algorithmic$
	cooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible,
	entropy-preserving manipulations (borrowed from data compression
	algorithms) with $selective$ $reset$, the transfer of entropy from
	selected spins to the environment. In theory, applying algorithmic
	cooling to sufficiently large spin systems may produce polarizations
	far beyond the limits due to conservation of Shannon entropy. Here,
	only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call
	this process "heat-bath" cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling.
	We experimentally implement here two consecutive steps of selective
	reset that transfer entropy from two selected spins to the environment.
	We performed such cooling experiments with commercially-available
	labeled molecules, on standard liquid-state NMR spectrometers. Our
	experiments yielded polarizations that $bypass$ $Shannon's$ $entropy$-$conservation$
	$bound$, so that the entire spin-system was cooled. This paper was
	initially submitted in 2005, first to Science and then to PNAS, and
	includes additional results from subsequent years (e.g. for resubmission
	in 2007). The Postscriptum includes more details.},

	quantum protocols, which can be proved to have exponentially lower
	communication costs than their classical counterparts for some problems.
	To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results regarding
	the quantum version of this problem, first studied by Schulman in
	a classical setting (FOCS '92, STOC '93). We simulate a length N
	quantum communication protocol by a length O(N) protocol. Our simulation
	strategy has a far higher communication rate than the naive one that
	encodes each particular round of communication to achieve comparable
	success. In particular, such a strategy would have a communication
	rate going to 0 in the worst interaction case as the length of the
	protocols increases, in contrast to our strategy, which has a communication
	rate proportional to the capacity of the channel used. Under adversarial
	noise, our strategy can withstand error rates up to 1/2 when parties
	preshare perfect entanglement, and this even if they are only allowed
	noisy classical communication. We show that this is optimal. This
	is in contrast to the case of the naive strategy, which would not
	work for any constant fraction of errors in this model. When the
	parties do not preshare entanglement, we show how to tolerate adversarial
	error rates close to the maximum tolerable for one-way quantum data
	transmission. In a random noise setting with a quantum channel of

  abstract = {Stoquastic Hamiltonians are characterized by the property that their
	off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard product basis are real
	and non-positive. Many interesting quantum models fall into this
	class including the Transverse field Ising Model (TIM), the Heisenberg
	model on bipartite graphs, and the bosonic Hubbard model. Here we
	consider the problem of estimating the ground state energy of a local
	stoquastic Hamiltonian $H$ with a promise that the ground state of
	$H$ has a non-negligible correlation with some `guiding' state that
	admits a concise classical description. A formalized version of this
	problem called Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonian is shown to be complete
	for the complexity class MA (a probabilistic analogue of NP). To
	prove this result we employ the Projection Monte Carlo algorithm
	with a variable number of walkers. Secondly, we show that the ground
	state and thermal equilibrium properties of the ferromagnetic TIM
	can be simulated in polynomial time on a classical probabilistic
	computer. This result is based on the approximation algorithm for
	the classical ferromagnetic Ising model due to Jerrrum and Sinclair
	(1993).},

  abstract = {Quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers known as LDPC codes have
	been actively studied recently due to their simple syndrome readout
	circuits and potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing.
	However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer
	from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code
	length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where
	good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding
	rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good
	quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant
	encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most
	$\sqrt{n}$ qubits, where $n$ is the code length. For comparison,
	all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers
	of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions
	of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from
	algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce
	good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight $n^a$ for any $a>0$.
	Finally, we apply the homological product to construct new small

  abstract = {Given a quantum error correcting code, an important task is to find
	encoded operations that can be implemented efficiently and fault-tolerantly.
	In this Letter we focus on topological stabilizer codes and encoded
	unitary gates that can be implemented by a constant-depth quantum
	circuit. Such gates have a certain degree of protection since propagation
	of errors in a constant-depth circuit is limited by a constant size
	light cone. For the 2D geometry we show that constant-depth circuits
	can only implement a finite group of encoded gates known as the Clifford
	group. This implies that topological protection must be "turned off"
	for at least some steps in the computation in order to achieve universality.
	For the 3D geometry we show that an encoded gate U is implementable
	by a constant-depth circuit only if the image of any Pauli operator
	under conjugation by U belongs to the Clifford group. This class
	of gates includes some non-Clifford gates such as the \pi/8 rotation.
	Our classification applies to any stabilizer code with geometrically

	Their goal is for Bob to learn Alice's input while using the channel
	as little as possible. In the zero-error regime, the optimal rates
	of source codes and channel codes are given by graph parameters known
	as the Witsenhausen rate and Shannon capacity, respectively. The
	Lov\'asz theta number, a graph parameter defined by a semidefinite

	Shannon capacity and it also upper bounds its entanglement-assisted
	counterpart. At the same time it was recently shown that the Shannon
	capacity can be increased if Alice and Bob may use entanglement.
	Here we partially extend these results to the source-coding problem
	and to the more general source-channel coding problem. We prove a
	lower bound on the rate of entanglement-assisted source-codes in
	terms Szegedy's number (a strengthening of the theta number). This

  abstract = {One-time programs are modelled after a black box that allows a single
	evaluation of a function, and then self-destructs. Because software
	can, in principle, be copied, general one-time programs exists only
	in the hardware token model: it has been shown that any function
	admits a one-time program as long as we assume access to physical
	devices called one-time memories. Quantum information, with its well-known
	property of no-cloning, would, at first glance, prevent the basic
	copying attack for classical programs. We show that this intuition
	is false: one-time programs for both classical and quantum maps,
	based solely on quantum information, do not exist, even with computational
	assumptions. We complement this strong impossibility proof by an
	equally strong possibility result: assuming the same basic one-time
	memories as used for classical one-time programs, we show that every
	quantum map has a quantum one-time program that is secure in the
	universal composability framework. Our construction relies on a new,
	simpler quantum authentication scheme and corresponding mechanism
	for computing on authenticated data.},

  note = {arXiv:1307.5540v1},
  abstract = {This paper introduces an information-based model for the pricing of
	storable commodities such as crude oil and natural gas. The model
	makes use of the concept of market information about future supply
	and demand as a basis for valuation. Physical ownership of a commodity
	is regarded as providing a stream of "convenience dividends" equivalent
	to a continuous cash flow. The market filtration is assumed to be
	generated jointly by (i) current and past levels of the dividend
	rate, and (ii) partial information concerning the future of the dividend
	flow. The price of a commodity is given by the expectation of the
	totality of the discounted risk-adjusted future convenience dividend,
	conditional on the information provided by the market filtration.
	In the situation where the dividend rate is modelled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
	process, the prices of options on commodities can be derived in closed
	form, both in the case when underlying is the spot price, and in
	the case when underlying is a futures price. The approach presented
	can be applied to other assets that can yield potentially negative
	effective cash flows, such as real estate, factories, refineries,
	mines, and power generating plants.},

  abstract = {In financial markets valuable information is rarely circulated homogeneously,
	because of time required for information to spread. However, advances
	in communication technology means that the 'lifetime' of important
	information is typically short. Hence, viewed as a tradable asset,
	information shares the characteristics of a perishable commodity:
	while it can be stored and transmitted freely, its worth diminishes
	rapidly in time. In view of recent developments where internet search
	engines and other information providers are offering information
	to financial institutions, the problem of pricing information is
	becoming increasingly important. With this in mind, a new formulation
	of utility-indifference argument is introduced and used as a basis
	for pricing information. Specifically, we regard information as a
	quantity that converts a prior distribution into a posterior distribution.
	The amount of information can then be quantified by relative entropy.
	The key to our utility indifference argument is to equate the maximised
	a posterior utility, after paying certain cost for the information,
	with the a posterior expectation of the utility based on the a priori
	optimal strategy. This formulation leads to one price for a given
	quantity of upside information; and another price for a given quantity
	of downside information. The ideas are illustrated by means of simple
	examples.},

  abstract = {Decoupling has become a central concept in quantum information theory
	with applications including proving coding theorems, randomness extraction

	our understanding of the dynamics that lead to decoupling is limited.
	In fact, the only families of transformations that are known to lead
	to decoupling are (approximate) unitary two-designs, i.e., measures
	over the unitary group which behave like the Haar measure as far
	as the first two moments are concerned. Such families include for
	example random quantum circuits with O(n^2) gates, where n is the

	Here, we prove that random quantum circuits with O(n log^2 n) gates
	satisfy an essentially optimal decoupling theorem. In addition, these
	circuits can be implemented in depth O(log^3 n). This proves that
	decoupling can happen in a time that scales polylogarithmically in

  note = {arXiv:1210.6644v2},
  abstract = {Random transformations are typically good at "scrambling" information.
	Specifically, in the quantum setting, scrambling usually refers to
	the process of mapping most initial pure product states under a unitary
	transformation to states which are macroscopically entangled, in
	the sense of being close to completely mixed on most subsystems containing
	a fraction fn of all n particles for some constant f. While the term
	scrambling is used in the context of the black hole information paradox,
	scrambling is related to problems involving decoupling in general,
	and to the question of how large isolated many-body systems reach
	local thermal equilibrium under their own unitary dynamics. Here,
	we study the speed at which various notions of scrambling/decoupling
	occur in a simplified but natural model of random two-particle interactions:
	random quantum circuits. For a circuit representing the dynamics
	generated by a local Hamiltonian, the depth of the circuit corresponds
	to time. Thus, we consider the depth of these circuits and we are
	typically interested in what can be done in a depth that is sublinear
	or even logarithmic in the size of the system. We resolve an outstanding
	conjecture raised in the context of the black hole information paradox
	with respect to the depth at which a typical quantum circuit generates
	an entanglement assisted encoding against the erasure channel. In
	addition, we prove that typical quantum circuits of poly(log n) depth
	satisfy a stronger notion of scrambling and can be used to encode
	alpha n qubits into n qubits so that up to beta n errors can be corrected,
	for some constants alpha, beta > 0.},

  abstract = {Understanding the thermodynamics of quantum systems is of fundamental
	importance, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.
	A growing interest has been recently given to small self-contained
	quantum thermal machines, the functioning of which requires no external
	source of work or control, but only incoherent interactions with
	thermal baths. The simplicity of such machines makes them and ideal
	test-bed for exploring quantum thermodynamics. So far, however, the
	importance of quantum effects in these machines has remained elusive.
	Here we show that entanglement, the paradigmatical quantum effect,
	plays a fundamental role in small self-contained quantum refrigerators,
	as it can enhance cooling and energy transport -- except notably
	when the efficiency is close to the Carnot limit. Hence a truly quantum
	refrigerator can outperform a classical one. Furthermore, the amount
	of entanglement alone quantifies the enhancement in cooling. More
	generally, our work shows that entanglement opens new possibilities
	in thermodynamics.},

  note = {arXiv:1211.3062v2},
  abstract = {This is intended to be a serious paper, in spite of the title. The
	idea is that quantum mechanics is about probabilistic correlations,
	i.e., about the structure of information, since a theory of information
	is essentially a theory of probabilistic correlations. To make this
	clear, it suffices to consider measurements of two binary-valued
	observables, x with outcomes a = 0 or 1, performed by Alice in a
	region A, and y with outcomes b = 0 or 1 performed by Bob in a separated
	region B --or, to emphasize the banality of the phenomena, two ways
	of peeling a banana, resulting in one of two tastes. The imagined
	bananas of Bananaworld are non-standard, with operational or phenomenal
	probabilistic correlations for peelings and tastes that lie outside
	the polytope of local correlations. The 'no go' theorems tell us
	that we can't shoe-horn these correlations into a classical correlation
	polytope, which has the structure of a simplex, by supposing that
	something has been left out of the story, without giving up fundamental
	principles that define what we mean by a physical system. The nonclassical
	features of quantum mechanics, including the irreducible information
	loss on measurement, are shown to be generic features of correlations
	that lie outside the local correlation polytope. As far as the conceptual
	problems are concerned, we might as well talk about bananas.},

  journal = {arXiv:1312.7455v1},
  year = {2013},
  month = {12},
  note = {arXiv:1312.7455v1},
  abstract = {We consider the natural extension of two-player nonlocal games to
	an arbitrary number of players. An important question for such nonlocal
	games is their behavior under parallel repetition. For two-player
	nonlocal games, it is known that both the classical and the non-signaling
	value of any game converges to zero exponentially fast under parallel
	repetition, given that the game is non-trivial to start with (i.e.,
	has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very recent results suggest
	that the same is true for the quantum value of a two-player game
	under parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more
	players, very little is known up to present on their behavior under
	parallel repetition; this is true for the classical, the quantum
	and the non-signaling value. In this work, we show a parallel repetition
	theorem for the non-signaling value of a large class of multi-player
	games, for an arbitrary number of players. Our result applies to
	all multi-player games for which all possible combinations of questions
	have positive probability; this class in particular includes all
	free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen independently.
	Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a non-signaling
	value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the $n$-fold
	parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$. Our parallel repetition
	theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the known parallel
	repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at which
	the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on
	the non-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible
	responses), but on the complete description of the game. Nevertheless,
	we feel that our result is a first - and so far the only - step towards
	a better understanding of the parallel repetition of nonlocal games
	with more than two players.},

	In particular we will review some of the design trade-offs at play
	in the floor-planning of the physical layout, driven by the desire

	the simultaneous need to embed programmable control circuitry into

	a cornerstone of quantum information science due to its essential

	demonstrate quantum teleportation of the polarization state of a

	crystal storing a single photon that is polarization-entangled with
	a flying telecom-wavelength photon. The latter is jointly measured
	with another flying qubit carrying the polarization state to be teleported,
	which heralds the teleportation. The fidelity of the polarization

  note = {arXiv:1310.3885v1},
  abstract = {A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph $G$ is given by the unitary
	matrix $U(t) = \exp(-itA)$, where $A$ is the Hermitian adjacency
	matrix of $G$. We say $G$ has pretty good state transfer between
	vertices $a$ and $b$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is a time $t$,
	where the $(a,b)$-entry of $U(t)$ satisfies $|U(t)_{a,b}| \ge 1-\epsilon$.
	This notion was introduced by Godsil (2011). The state transfer is
	perfect if the above holds for $\epsilon = 0$. In this work, we study
	a natural extension of this notion called universal state transfer.
	Here, state transfer exists between every pair of vertices of the
	graph. We prove the following results about graphs with this stronger
	property: (1) Graphs with universal state transfer have distinct
	eigenvalues and flat eigenbasis (where each eigenvector has entries
	which are equal in magnitude). (2) The switching automorphism group
	of a graph with universal state transfer is abelian and its order
	divides the size of the graph. Moreover, if the state transfer is
	perfect, then the switching automorphism group is cyclic. (3) There
	is a family of prime-length cycles with complex weights which has
	universal pretty good state transfer. This provides a concrete example
	of an infinite family of graphs with the universal property. (4)
	There exists a class of graphs with real symmetric adjacency matrices
	which has universal pretty good state transfer. In contrast, Kay
	(2011) proved that no graph with real-valued adjacency matrix can
	have universal perfect state transfer. We also provide a spectral
	characterization of universal perfect state transfer graphs that
	are switching equivalent to circulants.},

  abstract = {Quantum walks exhibit many unique characteristics compared to classical

	have been studied as a variation on the usual classical random walk.
	Classical self-avoiding random walks have found numerous applications,
	most notably in the modeling of protein folding. We consider the
	analogous problem in the quantum setting. We complement a quantum
	walk with a memory register that records where the walker has previously
	resided. The walker is then able to avoid returning back to previously
	visited sites. We parameterise the strength of the memory recording
	and the strength of the memory back-action on the walker's motion,
	and investigate their effect on the dynamics of the walk. We find
	that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce
	ideal quantum or classical random walk statistics, or a plethora
	of more elaborate diffusive phenomena. In some parameter regimes
	we observe a close correspondence between classical self-avoiding
	random walks and the quantum self-avoiding walk.},

  note = {arXiv:1311.2555v1},
  abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computation works by encoding problem instances
	into Hamiltonians. Experimental systems are typically limited to
	two-body interactions. Therefore, one needs a method to approximate
	quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary spectral error using
	at most two-body interactions. Hamiltonian gadgets, introduced over
	a decade ago, offer the only current means to address this requirement
	for general many-body Hamiltonians. Although the applications of
	Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily grown since their introduction,
	little progress has been made in overcoming the limitations of the
	gadgets themselves. In this experimentally motivated theoretical
	study, we propose several gadgets which have control parameters within
	reach of existing experimental hardware. We employ analytical techniques
	which result in a reduction of the resource scaling as a function
	of spectral error for the commonly used subdivision and 3- to 2-body
	gadgets. Next, we numerically optimize these new gadgets and fully
	characterize how the spectral gap scales with increasing locality
	in all known gadget constructions. Our analysis points to regimes
	and trade-offs where various constructions are shown to afford advantages.
	Finally, we introduce a new creation gadget which allows for the
	realization of any real-valued interaction using only XX and XZ couplers.
	This work represents a required step forward for the eventual realization
	of a universal adiabatic quantum information processor and paves
	the way for a first experimental implementation of these key building
	blocks by requiring less control precision without introducing extra
	ancillary qubits.},

	Evidence implies that the detection of ensembles of photons, which

	Total Probability for actual events, and we review proposals to drop
	each of these assumptions in light of the theorem. In particular,

  abstract = {Random access coding is an information task that has been extensively
	studied and found many applications in quantum information. In this
	scenario, Alice receives an $n$-bit string $x$, and wishes to encode
	$x$ into a quantum state $\rho_x$, such that Bob, when receiving
	the state $\rho_x$, can choose any bit $i \in [n]$ and recover the
	input bit $x_i$ with high probability. Here we study a variant called
	parity-oblivious random access codes, where we impose the cryptographic
	property that Bob cannot infer any information about the parity of
	any subset of bits of the input, apart from the single bits $x_i$.
	We provide the optimal quantum parity-oblivious random access codes
	and show that they are asymptotically better than the optimal classical
	ones. For this, we relate such encodings to a non-local game and
	provide tight bounds for the success probability of the non-local
	game via semidefinite programming. We also extend the well-known
	quantum random access codes for encoding $2$ or $3$ classical bits
	into a single qubit. Our results provide a large non-contextuality
	inequality violation and resolve the main open problem in a work
	of Spekkens, Buzacott, Keehn, Toner, and Pryde (2009).},

  note = {arXiv:1310.7787v1},
  abstract = {In a two player game, two cooperating but non communicating players,
	Alice and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution.
	Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy
	some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$
	of a game $G$ is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win
	the game if they are allowed to share an entangled state prior to
	receiving their inputs. The n-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$
	consists of $n$ instances of $G$ where Alice and Bob receive all
	the inputs at the same time and must produce all the outputs at the
	same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$. In this
	paper we show that for any game $G$ such that $\omega^*(G) = 1 -
	\varepsilon < 1$, $\omega^*(G^n)$ decreases exponentially in $n$.
	First, for any game $G$ on the uniform distribution, we show that
	$\omega^*(G^n) = (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log(|I||O|)}
	- |\log(\varepsilon)|\right)}$, where $|I|$ and $|O|$ are the dimensions
	of the input and output space. From this result, we show that for
	any entangled game $G$, $\omega^*(G^n) = (1 - {\varepsilon^2})^{\Omega(\frac{n}{Q^4
	\log(Q \cdot|O|)} - |\log(\varepsilon/Q)|)}$ where $p$ is the input
	distribution of $G$ and $Q = \max(\lceil \frac{1}{\min_{xy: p_{xy}
	\neq 0}(\sqrt{p_{xy})}}\rceil, |I|)$. This is the first time exponential
	decay is shown for the parallel repetition of any entangled game.
	To prove this parallel repetition, we introduce the concept of \emph{Superposed
	Information Cost} for entangled games which is inspired from the
	information cost used in communication complexity.},

	protocol [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 060502, (2012)] implemented using

	strongly modify the results of the preparatory step of the protocol.
	We find that the well-known method for locally increasing entanglement,
	phonon subtraction, may not result in entanglement gain when losses
	are taken into account. Thus, we investigate the critical number
	m_c of phonon subtraction attempts from the matter modes of the quantum
	memory. If the initial state is not de-Gaussified within m_c attempts,
	the protocol should be restarted to obtain any entanglement increase.
	Moreover, the condition m_c>1 implies an additional constraint on
	the subtraction beam splitter interaction transmissivity, viz. it
	should be about 50% for a wide range of protocol parameters. Additionally,
	we consider the average entanglement rate, which takes into account
	both the unavoidable probabilistic nature of the protocol and its
	possible failure as a result of a large number of unsuccessful subtraction
	attempts. We find that a higher value of the average entanglement

  abstract = {In this work, we extend the family of problems that may be implemented
	on an adiabatic quantum optimizer (AQO). When a quadratic optimization
	problem has at least one set of discrete controls and the constraints
	are linear, we call this a quadratic constrained mixed discrete optimization
	(QCMDO) problem. QCMDO problems are NP-hard, and no efficient classical
	algorithm for their solution is known. Included in the class of QCMDO
	problems are combinatorial optimization problems constrained by a
	linear partial differential equation (PDE) or system of linear PDEs.
	An essential complication commonly encountered in solving this type
	of problem is that the linear constraint may introduce many intermediate
	continuous variables into the optimization while the computational
	cost grows exponentially with problem size. We resolve this difficulty
	by developing a constructive mapping from QCMDO to quadratic unconstrained
	binary optimization (QUBO) such that the size of the QUBO problem
	depends only on the number of discrete control variables. With a
	suitable embedding, taking into account the physical constraints
	of the realizable coupling graph, the resulting QUBO problem can
	be implemented on an existing AQO. The mapping itself is efficient,

	general case and linearly in the PDE case if an efficient preconditioner

	Bell inequalities have been used to describe the restrictions imposed

	give rise to non-convex constraints on the accessible data, and it
	has recently been noted that linear inequalities on the observable
	entropies capture these situations more naturally. In this paper,
	we show the versatility of the entropic approach by greatly expanding
	the set of scenarios for which entropic constraints are known. For
	the first time, we treat Bell scenarios involving multiple parties

	we exhibit inequalities for scenarios with extra conditional independence
	assumptions, as well as a limited amount of shared randomness between

	Bell polytopes for two-outcome measurements can be naturally imbedded
	into the convex cone of attainable marginal entropies. Thus, any

  abstract = {Quantum key distribution uses public discussion protocols to establish
	shared secret keys. In the exploration of ultimate limits to such
	protocols, the property of symmetric extendibility of underlying
	bipartite states $\rho_{AB}$ plays an important role. A bipartite
	state $\rho_{AB}$ is symmetric extendible if there exits a tripartite
	state $\rho_{ABB'}$, such that the $AB$ marginal state is identical
	to the $AB'$ marginal state, i.e. $\rho_{AB'}=\rho_{AB}$. For a symmetric
	extendible state $\rho_{AB}$, the first task of the public discussion
	protocol is to break this symmetric extendibility. Therefore to characterize
	all bi-partite quantum states that possess symmetric extensions is
	of vital importance. We prove a simple analytical formula that a
	two-qubit state $\rho_{AB}$ admits a symmetric extension if and only
	if $\tr(\rho_B^2)\geq \tr(\rho_{AB}^2)-4\sqrt{\det{\rho_{AB}}}$.
	Given the intimate relationship between the symmetric extension problem
	and the quantum marginal problem, our result also provides the first
	analytical necessary and sufficient condition for the quantum marginal
	problem with overlapping marginals.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the conditions under which a given ensemble
	of two-qubit states can be optimally distinguished by local operations
	and classical communication (LOCC). We begin by completing the \emph{perfect}
	distinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable
	operations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions
	for the perfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then
	for the well-known task of minimum error discrimination, it is shown
	that \textit{almost all} two-qubit ensembles consisting of three
	pure states cannot be optimally discriminated using LOCC. This is
	surprising considering that \textit{any} two pure states can be distinguished
	optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given to ensembles that lack
	entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition for when
	a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by
	LOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as "non-locality
	without entanglement". We next consider an example of $N$ parties
	who each share the same state but who are ignorant of its identity.
	The state is drawn from the rotationally invariant "trine ensemble",
	and we establish a tight connection between the $N$-copy ensemble
	and Shor's "lifted" single-copy ensemble. For any finite $N$, we
	prove that optimal identification of the states cannot be achieved
	by LOCC; however as $N\to\infty$, LOCC can indeed discriminate the
	states optimally. This is the first result of its kind. Finally,
	we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new
	lower bounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states.
	When applied to the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather
	different distinguishability character than when the minimum-error
	probability is considered.},

	be replaced by the journal version with the same technical results
	and a new perspective of "Physical Randomness Extractors." We consider
	the Equivalence Lemma (4.6) a fundamental principle and powerful
	tool for securely composing untrusted-device protocols. E.g., it
	has immediate implications on "unbounded randomness expansion." The
	abstract below is new. How can one be certain that the output of
	an alleged random number generator is indeed random? This question
	is important not only for the security and the efficiency of modern
	day information processing, but also for understanding how fundamentally
	unpredictable events are possible in the physical world. The mathematical
	theory of randomness extraction from weak randomness sources shows
	that such certainty is possible only when two or more {\em independent}
	sources are available. To circumvent this fundamental and hard-to-enforce
	limit, here we propose a framework of extracting randomness from
	physical systems, and base the security on the validity of physical
	theories. We further demonstrate provably secure randomness extraction
	from untrusted devices that may be malicious but are nevertheless
	constrained by quantum mechanics and special relativity, using only
	one additional classical source that may even be known to the adversary
	and correlated strongly with the device. Our protocol tolerates a
	constant level of implementation imprecision, can reach close to
	optimal security and is efficient for important cases. Thus our result
	enables practical and provably secure randomness generation with
	a minimal assumption on the source and the generating devices. It
	also implies that unless the world is deterministic, we can experimentally
	create inherently random events and be confident of its unpredictability.},

  abstract = {Randomness is an important resource for many applications, from gambling
	to secure communication. However, guaranteeing that the output from
	a candidate random source could not have been predicted by an outside
	party is a challenging task, and many supposedly random sources used
	today provide no such guarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem
	exist, for example a device which internally sends a photon through
	a beam-splitter and observes on which side it emerges, but, presently,
	such solutions require the user to trust the internal workings of
	the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking whether
	randomness can be generated using untrusted devices---even ones created
	by an adversarial agent---while providing a guarantee that no outside
	party (including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily
	seen to be impossible unless the user has an initially private random
	string, the task we investigate here is private randomness expansion.
	We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted
	devices which is designed to take as input an initially private random
	string and produce as output a longer private random string. We point
	out that private randomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable
	to attacks that can render the initial string partially insecure,

  abstract = {The complementarity of two observables is often captured in uncertainty
	relations, which quantify an inevitable tradeoff in knowledge. Here
	we study complementarity in the context of an information processing
	task: we link the complementarity of two observables to their usefulness
	for superdense coding (SDC). In SDC, Alice sends two classical dits
	of information to Bob by sending a single qudit. While it is well
	known that preshared entanglement is necessary to achieve a quantum
	advantage in SDC (i.e., to send more than one dit per qudit), we
	find that complementarity is also necessary in the sense that the
	local unitaries Alice applies to her system must be non-commuting.
	Our main result shows that complementarity is also \textit{sufficient}
	to achieve a quantum advantage, when the preshared state is maximally
	entangled. More precisely, when Alice encodes her messages with products
	of Pauli operators for observables with non-zero complementarity
	then she can send Bob greater than one dit per qudit, and if the
	observables have nearly perfect complementarity then she can send
	nearly two dits per qudit. Our bound on the SDC capacity has a striking
	resemblance to uncertainty relations, and we also generalise our
	"uncertainty relation" to the case where the channel from Alice to
	Bob is noisy, and the preshared state is arbitrary. Our results shed

	introduced a quantity $\beta$ as an upper bound on the entanglement
	assisted independence number. We adapt and extend Beigi's argument
	to the context of source-channel coding (communication in the presence
	of side information). Entanglement assisted source-channel coding
	is possible only if there exists a set of vectors satisfying certain
	orthogonality conditions related to suitably defined graphs $G$ and
	$H$. We show that such vectors exist if and only if $\vartheta(\overline{G})

	$\vartheta^-$ and Szegedy $\vartheta^+$ numbers. These inequalities
	reproduce or generalize several known results, provide a bound on
	entanglement assisted source-channel coding, and provide tightened
	bounds on entanglement assisted one-shot zero-error capacity. In
	particular, we show that the entanglement assisted independence number
	is bounded by the Schrijver number: $\alpha^*(G) \le \vartheta^-(G)$.
	Therefore, we are able to disprove the conjecture that the one-shot
	entanglement-assisted zero-error capacity is equal to the integer
	part of the Lov\'asz number. Finally, Beigi posed the question of

	However, as practical devices tend to deviate from their specifications,
	the security of some practical QKD systems is no longer valid. In
	particular, an adversary can exploit imperfect detectors to learn
	a large part of the secret key, even though the security proof claims
	otherwise. Recently, a practical approach---measurement-device-independent
	QKD (mdiQKD)---has been proposed to solve this problem. However,
	so far the security has only been fully proven under the assumption
	that the legitimate users of the system have unlimited resources.
	Here we fill this gap and provide a rigorous security proof of mdiQKD
	against general attacks in the finite-key regime. This is obtained
	by applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound,
	to perform parameter estimation. For the first time we demonstrate

	and conceptual gap between the classical and the quantum world. To
	provide more unified framework the generalized probabilistic theories
	were formulated. Recently, it turned out that such theories include

	characteristics but predict supraquantum effects such as correlations
	stronger than quantum ones. As a result we reveal even more dramatic
	gap between classical/quantum and post-quantum world. Therefore it
	is imperative to search for information principles characterizing
	physical theories. In recent years, different principles has been
	proposed, however all of the principles considered so far do not
	involve uncertainty constraints. Here, we introduce an elementary
	system information content principle (ICP) whose basic ingredient
	is the phenomenon of Heisenberg uncertainty. The principle states
	that the amount of non-redundant information which may be extracted
	from a given single system is bounded by a perfectly decodable information
	content of the system. We show that this new principle is respected
	by classical and quantum theories and is violated by hidden variable
	theories as well as post-quantum ones: p-GNST and polygon theories.
	We also illustrate how the principle can be applied to composite
	systems. Remarkably, ICP is sometimes more sensitive than Tsirelson's
	bound: it allows to rule out even some theories which do not violate
	Tsirelson's bound. The elementary system character of ICP suggests
	that it might be one of the foundational bricks of Nature.},

	qubit readout: the average-signal (boxcar filter), peak-signal, and
	maximum-likelihood methods. In contrast to previous work, we account
	for a stochastic turn-on time $t_i$ associated with the leading edge
	of a pulse signaling one of the qubit states. This model is relevant
	to spin-qubit readouts based on spin-to-charge conversion and would
	be generically reached in the limit of large signal-to-noise ratio
	$r$ for several other physical systems, including fluorescence-based
	readouts of ion-trap qubits and nitrogen-vacancy center spins. We
	derive analytical closed-form expressions for the conditional probability
	distributions associated with the peak-signal and boxcar filters.
	For the boxcar filter, we find an asymptotic scaling of the single-shot
	error rate $\varepsilon \sim \ln r/\sqrt{r}$ when $t_i$ is stochastic,
	in contrast to the result $\varepsilon \sim \ln r/ r$ for deterministic
	$t_i$. Consequently, the peak-signal method outperforms the boxcar
	filter significantly when $t_i$ is stochastic, but is only marginally
	better for deterministic $t_i$ (a result that is consistent with
	the widespread use of the boxcar filter for fluorescence-based readouts
	and the peak-signal for spin-to-charge conversion). We generalize
	the theoretically optimal maximum-likelihood method to stochastic
	$t_i$ and show numerically that a stochastic turn-on time $t_i$ will
	always result in a larger single-shot error rate. Based on this observation,
	we propose a general strategy to improve the quality of single-shot
	readouts by forcing $t_i$ to be deterministic.},

	to find models with ground states that are universal for MBQC and

	interactions and have a small local Hilbert space dimension. Graph
	states are the original resource states for MBQC, and while it is
	not possible to obtain graph states as exact ground states of two-body
	Hamiltonians here we construct two-body frustration-free Hamiltonians

	model that has a ground state convertible to a graph state with stochastic
	local operations, then deforming the model such that its ground state
	is close to a graph state. Each graph state qubit resides in a subspace
	of a higher dimensional particle. This deformation can be applied
	to two-body frustration-free Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models,

	model, the ground state of which is not expected to be a universal

	the computational power of the ground state, promoting it to a universal
	resource for MBQC. Transitions in computational power, similar to
	percolation phase transitions, can be observed when Hamiltonians
	are deformed in this way. Improving the fidelity of the ground state
	comes at the cost of a shrinking gap. While analytically proving

	positive semi-definite operators \rho\ and \sigma. It depends on
	a parameter \alpha\ and acts as a parent quantity for other relative
	entropies which have important operational significances in quantum
	information theory: the quantum relative entropy and the min- and
	max-relative entropies. There is, however, another relative entropy,
	called the 0-relative Renyi entropy, which plays a key role in the
	analysis of various quantum information-processing tasks in the one-shot
	setting. We prove that the 0-relative Renyi entropy is obtainable
	from the quantum Renyi divergence only if \rho\ and \sigma\ have
	equal supports. This, along with existing results in the literature,
	suggests that operationally relevant entropic quantities in quantum
	information theory are obtainable from one of two parent quantities
	- the quantum Renyi divergence with parameter \alpha\ \ge 1/2, and
	the \alpha-relative Renyi entropy with \alpha\ \in [0,1/2).},

  abstract = {The entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is known to
	provide the formal quantum generalization of Shannon's classical
	channel capacity theorem, in the sense that it admits a single-letter
	characterization in terms of the quantum mutual information and does
	not increase in the presence of a noiseless quantum feedback channel
	from receiver to sender. In this work, we investigate the second-order
	asymptotics of the entanglement-assisted communication task. That
	is, we consider how quickly the rates of entanglement-assisted codes
	converge to the entanglement-assisted capacity of a channel as a
	function of the number of channel uses and the error tolerance. We
	define a quantum generalization of the mutual information variance
	of a channel in the entanglement-assisted setting. For covariant
	channels, we show that this quantity is equal to the channel dispersion,
	and characterizes the convergence towards the entanglement-assisted
	capacity when the number of channel uses increases. More generally,
	we prove that the Gaussian approximation of the second-order coding
	rate is achievable for all quantum channels.},

  abstract = {We advocate a new approach of addressing hidden structure problems

	the Hidden Symmetry Subgroup Problem (HSSP), which is a generalization
	of the well-studied Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP). Given a group
	acting on a set and an oracle whose level sets define a partition
	of the set, the task is to recover the subgroup of symmetries of
	this partition inside the group. The HSSP provides a unifying framework
	that, besides the HSP, encompasses a wide range of algebraic oracle
	problems, including quadratic hidden polynomial problems. While the
	HSSP can have provably exponential quantum query complexity, we obtain
	efficient quantum algorithms for various interesting cases. To achieve
	this, we present a general method for reducing the HSSP to the HSP,
	which works efficiently in several cases related to symmetries of
	polynomials. The HSSP therefore connects in a rather surprising way
	certain hidden polynomial problems with the HSP. Using this connection,
	we obtain the first efficient quantum algorithm for the hidden polynomial
	problem for multivariate quadratic polynomials over fields of constant
	characteristic. We also apply the new methods to polynomial function
	graph problems and present an efficient quantum procedure for constant

  abstract = {The reversible transfer of the quantum information between a photon,
	an information carrier, and a quantum memory with high fidelity and
	reliability is the prerequisite for realizing a long-distance quantum
	communication and a quantum network. Encoding photons into higher-dimensional
	states could significantly increase their information-carrying capability
	and network capacity. Moreover, the large-alphabet quantum key distribution
	affords a more secure flux of information. Quantum memories have
	been realized in different physical systems, such as atomic ensembles
	and solid systems etc., but to date, all quantum memories only realize
	the storage and retrieval of the photons lived in a two-dimensional
	space spanned for example by orthogonal polarizations, therefore
	only a quantum bit could be stored there. Here, we report on the
	first experimental realization of a quantum memory storing a photon
	lived in a three-dimensional space spanned by orbital angular momentums
	via electromagnetically induced transparency in a cold atomic ensemble.
	We reconstruct the storage process density matrix with the fidelity
	of 85.3% by the aid of a 4-f imaging system experimentally. The ability
	to store a high-dimensional quantum state with high fidelity is very
	promising for building a high-dimensional quantum network.},

  note = {arXiv:1310.4113v1},
  abstract = {We study the behavior of the entangled value of two-player one-round
	projection games under parallel repetition. We show that for any
	projection game $G$ of entangled value 1-eps < 1, the value of the
	$k$-fold repetition of G goes to zero as O((1-eps^c)^k), for some
	universal constant c\geq 1. Previously parallel repetition with an
	exponential decay in $k$ was only known for the case of XOR and unique
	games. To prove the theorem we extend an analytical framework recently
	introduced by Dinur and Steurer for the study of the classical value
	of projection games under parallel repetition. Our proof, as theirs,
	relies on the introduction of a simple relaxation of the entangled
	value that is perfectly multiplicative. The main technical component
	of the proof consists in showing that the relaxed value remains tightly
	connected to the entangled value, thereby establishing the parallel
	repetition theorem. More generally, we obtain results on the behavior
	of the entangled value under products of arbitrary (not necessarily
	identical) projection games. Relating our relaxed value to the entangled
	value is done by giving an algorithm for converting a relaxed variant
	of quantum strategies that we call "vector quantum strategy" to a
	quantum strategy. The algorithm is considerably simpler in case the
	bipartite distribution of questions in the game has good expansion
	properties. When this is not the case, rounding relies on a quantum
	analogue of Holenstein's correlated sampling lemma which may be of
	independent interest. Our "quantum correlated sampling lemma" generalizes
	results of van Dam and Hayden on universal embezzlement.},

  abstract = {Complete positivity of quantum dynamics is often viewed as a litmus
	test for physicality, yet it is well known that correlated initial
	states need not give rise to completely positive evolutions. This
	observation spurred numerous investigations over the past two decades
	attempting to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for complete
	positivity. Here we describe a complete and consistent mathematical
	framework for the discussion and analysis of complete positivity
	for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. Our key observation
	is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on
	the system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to
	system-bath states with the same reduced state on the system, in
	order to ensure that the induced dynamical maps on the system are
	well-defined. Once this consistency condition is imposed, related
	concepts like the assignment map and the dynamical maps are uniquely
	defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be applied to arbitrary
	system states, but only to those in an appropriately defined physical
	domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem gives
	rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.
	Using this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts
	to provide conditions for complete positivity using quantum discord
	and the quantum data-processing inequality. The problem remains open,

  abstract = {We critically revisit the definitions of mean-squared estimation error
	and disturbance recently used in error-disturbance inequalities derived
	by Ozawa, Hall, Branciard, and Weston et al. by expressing them in
	the reduced system space. The interpretation of the definitions as
	mean-squared deviations relies on a hidden assumption that is incompatible
	with the Bell-Kochen-Specker-Spekkens contextuality theorems, and
	which results in averaging the deviations over a non-positive-definite
	joint quasiprobability distribution. For unbiased measurements, the
	estimation error admits a concrete interpretation as the dispersion
	in the estimation of the mean induced by the measurement ambiguity.
	We demonstrate how to measure not only this dispersion but also every
	observable moment with the same experimental data, and thus demonstrate
	that perfect estimations can have nonzero estimation error according
	to this measure. We conclude that the inequalities using these definitions
	do not capture the spirit of Heisenberg's eponymous inequality, but
	do indicate a qualitatively different relationship between dispersion
	and disturbance that applies to ensembles of measurements. To reconnect
	with the discussion of Heisenberg, we suggest alternate definitions
	of error and disturbance that are intrinsic to a single apparatus
	outcome. These definitions naturally involve the retrodictive and
	interdictive states for that outcome, and produce complementarity
	and error-disturbance inequalities that have the same form as the
	traditional Heisenberg relation.},

  abstract = {We study electromagnetically induced interference at superconducting
	qubits. The interaction between qubits and electromagnetic fields
	can provide additional coupling channels to qubit states, leading
	to quantum interference in a microwave driven qubit. In particular,
	the interwell relaxation or Rabi oscillation, resulting respectively
	from the multi- or single-mode interaction, can induce effective
	crossovers. The environment is modeled by a multi-mode thermal bath,
	generating the interwell relaxation. Relaxation induced interference,
	independent of the tunnel coupling, provides deeper understanding
	to the interaction between the qubits and their environment. It also
	supplies a useful tool to characterize the relaxation strength as
	well as the characteristic frequency of the bath. In addition, we
	demonstrate the relaxation can generate population inversion in a
	strongly driving two-level system. On the other hand, different from
	Rabi oscillation, Rabi oscillation induced interference involves
	more complicated and modulated photon exchange thus offers an alternative
	means to manipulate the qubit, with more controllable parameters
	including the strength and position of the tunnel coupling. It also

	One essential question in quantum simulation is how to probe the
	properties of an emulated many-body system, such as the correlation
	in its ground state and the spectrum of the elementary excitations.
	Here we present a circuit QED scheme for probing such many-body properties
	by measuring the correlation spectrum of a superconducting resonator
	coupled to a quantum simulator. We develop a general framework for
	the scheme and derive the correlation spectrum of the resonator by
	solving the Heisenberg-Langevin equation. The correlation spectrum
	contains contributions of the correlation function of the simulator,
	and hence bears distinct features of the many-body phases. For illustration,
	we apply this scheme to a quantum simulator for the transverse field
	Ising model that couples to a superconducting resonator. The simulator
	can be implemented with an array of superconducting flux qubits.
	We calculate the correlation spectrum of the resonator when the simulator
	is under periodic and open boundary conditions, and also consider
	the spatial dependence of the microwave field in the resonator. Our
	results show that the resonance peaks in the correlation spectrum
	can be exactly mapped to the elementary excitations of the simulator.
	The effects of resonator damping and qubit decoherence at finite

  abstract = {Non-local correlations are among the most fascinating features of
	quantum theory from the point of view of information: Such correlations,

	information. The correlations have applications in cryptography,
	communication complexity, and sit at the very heart of many attempts

	classical information. In these contexts, the question is crucial
	whether such correlations can be amplified or distilled, i.e., whether
	and how weak correlations can be used for generating (a smaller amount
	of) stronger. Whereas the question has been studied quite extensively
	for bipartite correlations (yielding both pessimistic and optimistic
	results), only little is known in the multi-partite case. We introduce
	a general framework of reductions between multi-party input-output
	systems. Within this formalism, we show that a natural n-party generalization
	of the well-known Popescu-Rohrlich box can be distilled, by an adaptive
	protocol, to the algebraic maximum.We use this result further to
	show that a much broader class of correlations, including all purely
	threepartite correlations, can be distilled from arbitrarily weak
	to almost maximal strength with partial communication, i.e., using
	only a subset of the channels required for the creation of the same

  abstract = {Quantum theory puts forward phenomena unexplainable by classical physics
	- or information, for that matter. A prominent example is non-locality.
	Non-local correlations cannot be explained, in classical terms, by
	shared information but only by communication. On the other hand,
	the phenomenon does not allow for (potentially faster-than-light)
	message transmission. The fact that some non-local and non-signaling
	correlations are predicted by quantum theory, whereas others fail
	to be, asks for a criterion, as simple as possible, that characterizes
	which joint input-output behaviors are ``quantum'' and which are
	not. In the context of the derivation of such criteria, it is of
	central importance to understand when non-local correlations can
	be amplified by a non-interactive protocol, i.e., whether some types
	of weak non-locality can be distilled into stronger by local operations.
	Since it has been recognized that the searched-for criteria must
	inherently be multi-partite, the question of distillation, extensively
	studied and understood two-party scenarios, should be adressed in
	the multi-user setting, where much less is known. Considering the
	space of intrinsically n-partite correlations, we show the possibility
	of distilling weak non-local boxes to the algebraically maximal ones
	without any communication. Our protocols improve on previously known
	methods which still required partial communication. The price we
	have to pay for dropping the need for communication entirely is the
	assumption of permutation invariance: Any correlation that can be
	realized between some set of players is possible between any such
	set. This assumption is very natural since the laws of physics are
	invariant under spacial translation.},

  abstract = {Quantum correlations are critical to our understanding of nature,
	with far-reaching technological and fundamental impact. These often
	manifest as violations of Bell's inequalities, bounds derived from
	the assumptions of locality and realism, concepts integral to classical
	physics. Many tests of Bell's inequalities have studied pairs of
	correlated particles; however, the immense interest in multi-particle
	quantum correlations is driving the experimental frontier to test
	systems beyond just pairs. All experimental violations of Bell's
	inequalities to date require supplementary assumptions, opening the
	results to one or more loopholes, the closing of which is one of
	the most important challenges in quantum science. Individual loopholes
	have been closed in experiments with pairs of particles and a very
	recent result closed the detection loophole in a six ion experiment.
	No experiment thus far has closed the locality loopholes with three
	or more particles. Here, we distribute three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
	entangled states using optical fibre and free-space links to independent
	measurement stations. The measured correlations constitute a test
	of Mermin's inequality while closing both the locality and related

	is noisy. We show that our implementation is secure under this model

  abstract = {Determining community structure in interacting systems, ranging from

	of central importance in the study of networks. Extending this concept
	to apply to quantum systems represents an open challenge and a crucial
	missing component towards a theory of complex networks based on quantum
	mechanics. Here we accomplish this goal by introducing methods for
	identifying the community structure of a network governed by quantum
	dynamics. To illustrate our approach we turn to a host of examples,
	including a naturally occurring light-harvesting network, where from
	first principles we determine a consistent community structure. In
	certain regimes the communities we determine agree with a partitioning
	currently done by hand in the quantum chemistry literature. In other
	regimes, we uncover a new community structure. The difference stems
	from defining measures to determine distances between nodes in quantum
	systems, and then determining optimal modularity. Merging concepts
	from quantum physics and complex network theory is providing a bidirectional
	bridge of relevant analysis tools to address networks in both disciplines.
	Although this work focuses on extending the concept of community
	detection to apply to quantum systems, it also opens the door for
	the application of quantum techniques to determine community structure

	data structures with quantum access. In the quantum access model,
	data is stored in classical bits, but they can be accessed in a quantum
	way: We may read several bits in superposition for unit cost. We
	give proofs for lower bounds in this setting that show that the classical
	data structures from the first section are, in some sense, asymptotically
	optimal - even in the quantum model. In fact, these proofs are simpler
	and give stronger results than previous proofs for the classical
	model of computation. The lower bound for set membership was proved

	encode it in qubits. We allow any unitary operation or measurement

	some one way communication complexity problems can be solved within
	a GPT is equivalent to the recently introduced cone factorisation
	of the corresponding communication matrix $M$. Polytopes and optimising
	functions over polytopes arise in many areas of discrete mathematics.
	A conic extension of a polytope is the intersection of a cone $C$
	with an affine subspace whose projection onto the original space
	yields the desired polytope. Extensions of polytopes can sometimes
	be much simpler geometric objects than the polytope itself. The existence
	of a conic extension of a polytope is equivalent to that of a cone
	factorisation of the slack matrix of the polytope, on the same cone.
	We show that all combinatorial polytopes, including the travelling
	salesman polytope and any polytope whose vertices can be recognized
	by a polynomial size circuit, have small conic extension complexity
	when the cone is the completely positive cone. Using recent exponential
	lower bounds on the linear extension complexity of the travelling
	salesman polytope, this provides an exponential gap between the communication
	complexity of GPT based on the completely positive cone and classical
	communication complexity, and a conjectured exponential gap with
	quantum communication complexity. Our work thus relates the communication
	complexity of generalisations of quantum theory to questions of mainstream
	interest in the area of combinatorial optimisation.},

	first of our main contributions is an exponentially better method
	for sampling approximations of vectors of the dual lattice of the
	period lattice than the methods outlined in the works of Hallgren
	and Schmidt and Vollmer. This new method improves the success probability

	teleportation protocol to a Heisenberg spin particle pair initially

	The thermal states of the spin pair are quantum correlated (entangled

	We compare energy teleportation to particle B with direct local energy
	extraction by a general quantum operation on B and discover essentially
	two regimes: a high temperature regime where teleportation yields

	part (MIQM), which applies to a closed quantum system of any size,
	and a 'macroscopic' part (MAQM), which requires the participation
	of a large (ideally, an infinite) system. The first (MIQM) can be
	fully formulated based solely on the assumption of a Hilbert space
	ontology and the noncontextuality of probability values, relying
	in an essential way on Gleason's theorem and on an application to
	dynamics due in large part to Nistico. The microscopic theory does
	not, however, possess a unique corpus of assertions, but rather a
	multiplicity of contextual truths ('c-truths'), each one associated
	with a different framework. This circumstance leads us to consider
	the microscopic theory to be physically indeterminate and therefore
	incomplete, though logically coherent. The completion of the theory
	requires a macroscopic mechanism for selecting a physical framework,
	which is part of the macroscopic theory (MAQM). Detailed definitions
	and proofs are presented in the appendices},

  abstract = {A central aim of relativistic quantum information (RQI) is the investigation
	of quantum information tasks and resources taking into account the
	relativistic aspects of nature. More precisely, it is of fundamental
	interest to understand how the storage, manipulation, and transmission
	of information utilizing quantum systems are influenced by the fact
	that these processes take place in a relativistic spacetime. In particular,
	many studies in RQI have been focused on the effects of non-uniform
	motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum information
	protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed
	in highly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical
	accessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it
	is necessary to consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible
	to localized observers. In this thesis we present such a model, the
	rigid relativistic cavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects
	of motion on entanglement and applications such as quantum teleportation.
	We study cavities in (1+1) dimensions undergoing non-uniform motion,
	consisting of segments of uniform acceleration and inertial motion
	of arbitrary duration that allow the involved velocities to become
	relativistic. The transitions between segments can be sharp or smooth
	and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus lies
	in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar
	fields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov
	transformations change the particle content and the occupation of
	the energy levels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate
	entanglement between the modes of the quantum fields inside a single
	cavity for various initial states. The entanglement between several
	cavities, on the other hand, is degraded by the non-uniform motion,
	influencing the fidelity of tasks such as teleportation.},

	of 100 years ago (pragmatism, pluralism, nonreductionism, and meliorism).
	Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter Institute is focused
	on the hard technical problem of finding a good representation of
	quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without amplitudes
	or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation involves
	a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete quantum

	Rule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable
	when an agent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions
	with a newly recognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space
	dimension). (The word "capacity" should conjure up an image of something
	like gravitational mass---a body's mass measures its capacity to
	attract other bodies. With hindsight one can say that the founders

	hypothesis that defocusing attention results in divergent or associative
	thought, conducive to insight and finding unusual connections, while
	focusing attention results in convergent or analytic thought, conducive
	to rule-based operations. Creativity appears to involve both. It
	is widely believed that it is possible to escape mental fixation
	by spontaneously and temporarily engaging in a more associative mode
	of thought. The resulting insight (if found) may be refined in a
	more analytic mode of thought. The questions addressed here are:
	(1) how does the architecture of memory support these two modes of
	thought, and (2) what is happening at the neural level when one shifts
	between them? Recent advances in neuroscience shed light on this.
	Activated cell assemblies are composed of multiple neural cliques,
	groups of neurons that respond differentially to general or context-specific
	aspects of a situation. I refer to neural cliques that would not
	be included in the assembly if one were in an analytic mode, but
	would be if one were in an associative mode, as neurds. It is posited
	that the shift to a more associative mode of thought is accomplished
	by recruiting neurds that respond to abstract or atypical microfeatures
	of the problem or task. Since memory is distributed and content-addressable,
	this fosters the forging of associations to potentially relevant
	items previously encoded in those neurons. Thus it is proposed that

  abstract = {The research field of quantum entanglement theory is comparatively
	new. While a basic understanding of the most simple systems in question
	(i.e. bipartite systems) has been established over the past few decades,
	multipartite entanglement still holds many unsolved questions and
	intriguing riddles. In particular, it is completely unclear how several
	concepts from the bipartite case can be generalised in a meaningful
	way to multipartite scenarios. In this work, the main issues of multipartite
	entanglement detection, characterisation and classification are discussed.
	The differences and similarities between the bipartite and the multipartite
	situation are reviewed, various possible generalisations are presented
	and results are obtained in several areas. The focus of this work
	particularly lies on a formalism - the so called HMGH framework,
	which has been developed and expanded for the past several years
	- which allows for construction of very specific separability criteria,
	capable of discriminating between different kinds of multipartite
	entanglement. By means of these criteria, the questions of partial
	separability, genuine multipartite entanglement and - ultimately
	- multipartite entanglement classification (which appear to contain
	the most striking differences to bipartite entanglement) are adressed
	and discussed. In order to illustrate the theoretical conclusions
	in these respects, several examples are given from different (and
	differently closely related) fields, showing the capabilities, strengths
	and weaknesses of the HMGH framework as well as giving insights into
	the current status of research in multipartite entanglement theory

  abstract = {In this paper we construct quantum algorithms for matrix products
	over several algebraic structures called semirings, including the

	matrix product. In particular, we obtain the following results. We
	construct a quantum algorithm computing the product of two n x n
	matrices over the (max,min) semiring with time complexity O(n^{2.473}).
	In comparison, the best known classical algorithm for the same problem,
	by Duan and Pettie, has complexity O(n^{2.687}). As an application,
	we obtain a O(n^{2.473})-time quantum algorithm for computing the
	all-pairs bottleneck paths of a graph with n vertices, while classically
	the best upper bound for this task is O(n^{2.687}), again by Duan
	and Pettie. We construct a quantum algorithm computing the L most
	significant bits of each entry of the distance product of two n x
	n matrices in time O(2^{0.64L} n^{2.46}). In comparison, prior to
	the present work, the best known classical algorithm for the same

	Our techniques lead to further improvements for classical algorithms
	as well, reducing the classical complexity to O(2^{0.96L}n^{2.69}),
	which gives a sublinear dependency on 2^L. The above two algorithms
	are the first quantum algorithms that perform better than the $\tilde
	O(n^{5/2})$-time straightforward quantum algorithm based on quantum
	search for matrix multiplication over these semirings. We also consider
	the Boolean semiring, and construct a quantum algorithm computing
	the product of two n x n Boolean matrices that outperforms the best
	known classical algorithms for sparse matrices. For instance, if
	the input matrices have O(n^{1.686...}) non-zero entries, then our
	algorithm has time complexity O(n^{2.277}), while the best classical

  abstract = {The time or cost of simulating a quantum circuit by adiabatic evolution
	is determined by the spectral gap of the Hamiltonians involved in
	the simulation. In "standard" constructions based on Feynman's Hamiltonian,
	such a gap decreases polynomially with the number of gates in the
	circuit, L. Because a larger gap implies a smaller cost, we study
	the limits of spectral gap amplification in this context. We show
	that, under some assumptions on the ground states and the cost of
	evolving with the Hamiltonians (which apply to the standard constructions),
	an upper bound on the gap of order 1/L follows. In addition, if the
	Hamiltonians satisfy a frustration-free property, the upper bound
	is of order 1/L^2. Our proofs use recent results on adiabatic state
	transformations, spectral gap amplification, and the simulation of
	continuous-time quantum query algorithms. They also consider a reduction
	from the unstructured search problem, whose lower bound in the oracle
	cost translates into the upper bounds in the gaps. The impact of
	our results is that improving the gap beyond that of standard constructions

  abstract = {Acin et al. introduced a unified framework for the study of no-signalling
	correlations. Such a framework is based on the notion of local quantum
	measurements, but, in order to account for beyond-quantum correlations,
	global pseudo-states that are not positive semidefinite are allowed.
	After a short review of the formalism, we consider its use in the
	quantification of both general non-local and beyond-quantum correlations.
	We argue that the unified framework for correlations provides a simple
	approach to such a quantification, in particular when the quantification
	is meant to be operational and meaningful in a resource-theory scenario,
	i.e., when considering the processing of resources by means of non-resources.
	We relate different notions of robustness of correlations, both at
	the level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability distributions,
	with particular focus on the beyond-quantum robustness of correlations
	and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue that, within
	the unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that
	of operators and that of probability distributions---is very strict.
	We point out how the consideration of robustness at the two levels
	leads to a natural framework for the quantification of entanglement
	in a device-independent way. Finally, we show that the beyond-quantum
	robustness of the non-positive operators needed to achieve beyond-quantum
	correlations coincides with their negativity and their distance from
	the set of quantum states. As an example, we calculate the beyond-quantum
	robustness for the case of a noisy Popescu-Rohrlich box.},

	the presence of the leakage event is apparent and detectable. However,
	there is also the possibility of a less typical but more dangerous
	type of leakage event, where the ancilla becomes paralyzed, rendering
	it oblivious to data-qubit errors for many consecutive measurement
	cycles and compromising the fault-tolerance. Certain dynamical phases
	associated with the entangling gate determine which type of leakage

  abstract = {We consider quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates. In
	this context the T gate has a special status since it confers universal
	computation when added to the (classically simulable) Clifford gates.
	However it can be very expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. We
	therefore view this gate as a resource which should be used only
	when necessary. Given an n-qubit unitary U we are interested in computing
	a circuit that implements it using the minimum possible number of
	T gates (called the T-count of U). A related task is to decide if
	the T-count of U is less than or equal to m; we consider this problem
	as a function of N=2^n and m. We provide a classical algorithm which
	solves it using time and space both upper bounded as O(N^m poly(m,N)).
	We implemented our algorithm and used it to show that any Clifford+T
	circuit for the Toffoli or the Fredkin gate requires at least 7 T
	gates. This implies that the known 7 T gate circuits for these gates
	are T-optimal. We also provide a simple expression for the T-count

  note = {arXiv:1309.6586v1},
  abstract = {We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the
	light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic
	perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of
	what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that
	the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement
	for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States
	that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider
	the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial
	Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate).
	In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to
	the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium
	states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states
	that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation
	we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest
	here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation.
	We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate,
	single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case,
	we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion
	to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical
	representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also
	review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in
	particular through the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state
	conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always
	reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently
	quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of
	work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second
	law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether
	or not a given state transition is possible.},

  note = {arXiv:1309.0478v1},
  abstract = {A remarkable feature of quantum theory is that particles with identical
	intrinsic properties must be treated as indistinguishable if the
	theory is to give valid predictions. For example, our understanding
	of the structure of the periodic table hinges on treating the electrons
	in multi-electron atoms as indistinguishable. In the quantum formalism,
	indistinguishability is expressed via the symmetrization postulate,
	which restricts a system of identical particles to the set of symmetric
	states (`bosons') or the set of antisymmetric states (`fermions').
	However, the precise connection between particle indistinguishability
	and the symmetrization postulate has not been established. There
	exist a number of variants of the postulate that appear to be compatible
	with particle indistinguishability, and a well-known derivation of
	the postulate implies that its validity depends on the dimensionality
	of space. These variants leave open the possibility that there exist
	elementary particles, such as anyons, which violate the symmetrization
	postulate. Here we show that the symmetrization postulate can be
	derived on the basis of the indistinguishability postulate. This
	postulate establishes a functional relationship between the amplitude
	of a process involving indistinguishable particles and the amplitudes
	of all possible transitions when the particles are treated as distinguishable.
	The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency with
	the rest of the quantum formalism. The key to the derivation is a
	strictly informational treatment of indistinguishability which prohibits
	the labelling of particles that cannot be experimentally distinguished
	from one another. The derivation implies that the symmetrization
	postulate admits no natural variants. In particular, the existence
	of anyons as elementary particles is excluded.},

	a lack of programming languages for describing quantum computation
	on a practical scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems.
	We address this issue by introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive,
	functional, higher-order quantum programming language. Quipper has
	been used to program a diverse set of non-trivial quantum algorithms,
	and can generate quantum gate representations using trillions of
	gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses a classical
	computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any
	particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective
	and easy to use, and opens the door towards using formal methods
	to analyze quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {At the heart of understanding the emergence of a classical world from
	quantum theory is the insight that all macroscopic quantum systems
	are to some extent coupled to an environment and hence are open systems.
	The associated loss of quantum coherence, i.e., decoherence, is also
	detrimental for quantum information processing applications. In contrast,
	properly engineered quantum noise can counteract decoherence and
	can even be used in robust quantum state generation. To exploit the
	detailed dynamics of a quantum system it is therefore crucial to
	obtain both good knowledge and control over its environment. Here
	we present a method to reconstruct the relevant properties of the
	environment, that is, its spectral density, of the center of mass
	motion of a micro-mechanical oscillator. We observe a clear signature
	of non-Markovian Brownian motion, which is in contrast to the current
	paradigm to treat the thermal environment of mechanical quantum resonators
	as fully Markovian. The presented method, inspired by methods of
	system identification, can easily be transferred to other harmonic
	systems that are embedded in a complex environment, for example electronic

	The question we raise, is whether any racbox can simulate PR-box.
	We show that a non-signaling racbox indeed can simulate PR-box, hence

  abstract = {The locking effect is a phenomenon which is unique to quantum information
	theory and represents one of the strongest separations between the
	classical and quantum theories of information. The Fawzi-Hayden-Sen
	(FHS) locking protocol harnesses this effect in a cryptographic context,
	whereby one party can encode n bits into n qubits while using a log(n)-bit
	secret key, with the guarantee that an eavesdropper who performs
	a measurement on the encoded qubits can recover only an arbitrarily
	small number of the encoded bits. This is an extreme violation of
	Shannon's classical theorem, which states that information-theoretic
	security holds in the classical case if and only if the secret key
	is the same size as the message. Given this intriguing phenomenon,
	it is of practical interest to study this effect in the presence
	of noise, which can occur on both the system of the legitimate receiver
	and the eavesdropper. This paper formally defines the locking capacity
	of a quantum channel as the maximum amount of locked information
	that can be reliably transmitted to a legitimate receiver by exploiting
	many independent uses of a quantum channel and an amount of secret
	key sublinear in the number of channel uses. We provide general operational
	bounds on the locking capacity in terms of other well-known capacities
	from quantum Shannon theory. We also study the important case of
	bosonic channels, finding limitations on these channels' locking
	capacity when coherent-state encodings are employed and particular
	locking protocols for these channels that might be physically implementable.},

  abstract = {The theory of quantum gravity is aimed to fuse general relativity
	with quantum theory into a more fundamental framework. The space
	of quantum gravity provides both the non-fixed causality of general
	relativity and the quantum uncertainty of quantum mechanics. In a
	quantum gravity scenario, the causal structure is indefinite and
	the processes are causally non-separable. In this work, we provide
	a model for the information processing structure of quantum gravity.
	We show that the quantum gravity environment is an information resource-pool
	from which valuable information can be extracted. We analyze the
	structure of the quantum gravity space and the entanglement of the
	space-time geometry. We study the information transfer capabilities
	of quantum gravity space and define the quantum gravity channel.
	We reveal that the quantum gravity space acts as a background noise
	on the local environment states. We characterize the properties of
	the noise of the quantum gravity space and show that it allows the
	separate local parties to simulate remote outputs from the local
	environment state, through the process of remote simulation. We characterize
	the information transfer of the gravity space and the correlation
	measure functions of the gravity channel. We investigate the process
	of stimulated storage for quantum gravity memories, a phenomenon
	that exploits the information resource-pool property of quantum gravity.
	The results confirm the perception that the benefits of the quantum
	gravity space can be exploited in quantum computations, particularly
	in the development of quantum computers.},

  abstract = {We propose the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division-multiuser
	quadrature allocation (AMQD-MQA) multiple access technique for continuous-variable
	quantum key distribution (CVQKD). The MQA scheme is based on the
	AMQD modulation, which granulates the inputs of the users into Gaussian
	subcarrier continuous-variables (CVs). The subcarrier coherent states
	formulate Gaussian sub-channels from the physical link with diverse
	transmittance coefficients. In an AMQD-MQA multiple access scenario,
	the simultaneous reliable transmission of the users is handled by
	the dynamic allocation of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs. We propose
	two different settings of AMQD-MQA for multiple input-multiple output
	communication. We introduce a rate-selection strategy that tunes
	the modulation variances and allocates adaptively the quadratures
	of the users over the sub-channels. We also prove the rate formulas
	if only partial channel side information is available for the users
	of the sub-channel conditions. In an experimental CVQKD scenario,
	an ideal Gaussian input modulation can only be approximated, which
	affects the quadrature adaption and the efficiency of the transmission.
	We show a technique for the compensation of a nonideal Gaussian input
	modulation, which allows the users to overwhelm the modulation imperfections
	to reach optimal capacity-achieving communication over the Gaussian
	sub-channels. We investigate the diversity amplification of the sub-channel
	transmittance coefficients and reveal that a strong diversity can
	be exploited by opportunistic Gaussian modulation.},

  abstract = {This thesis addresses whether it is possible to build a robust memory
	device for quantum information. A three-dimensional gapped lattice
	spin model is found which demonstrates for the first time that a
	reliable quantum memory at finite temperature is possible, at least
	to some extent. When quantum information is encoded into a highly
	entangled ground state of this model and subjected to thermal errors,
	the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without any
	active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the
	errors well localized. As a result, stored quantum information can
	be retrieved faithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially
	with the square of the inverse temperature. In contrast, for previously
	known types of topological quantum storage in three or fewer spatial
	dimensions the memory time scales exponentially with the inverse
	temperature, rather than its square. This spin model exhibits a previously
	unexpected topological quantum order, in which ground states are
	locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are immobile, and
	the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian.
	The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to perturbations,
	is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size, and
	the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself
	under real-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy,
	the excitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed
	using a framework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some
	associated free resolutions of modules over polynomial algebras.},

  abstract = {Fine's theorem concerns the question of determining the conditions
	under which a certain set of probabilities for pairs of four bivalent
	quantities may be taken to be the marginals of an underlying probability
	distribution. The eight CHSH inequalities are well-known to be necessary
	conditions, but Fine's theorem is the striking result that they are
	also a sufficient condition. It has application to the question of
	finding a local hidden variables theory for measurements of pairs
	of spins for a system in an EPRB state. Here we present two simple
	and self-contained proofs of Fine's theorem in which the origins
	of this non-obvious result can be easily seen. The first is a physically
	motivated proof which simply notes that this matching problem is
	solved using a local hidden variables model given by Peres. The second
	is a straightforward algebraic proof which uses a representation
	of the probabilities in terms of correlation functions and takes
	advantage of certain simplifications naturally arising in that representation.
	A third, unsuccessful attempt at a proof, involving the maximum entropy
	technique is also briefly described},

  abstract = {One of the most important properties of quantum information, and the
	one ultimately responsible for its cryptographic applications, is
	that it can't be copied. That statement, however, is not completely
	accurate. While the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics prevents
	quantum information from being copied in space, the reversibility
	of microscopic physics actually requires that the information be
	copied in time. In spacetime as a whole, therefore, quantum information
	is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully characterize
	which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum information.
	Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum error
	correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined trajectories.
	Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of spacetime
	regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning
	principle is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational
	question of exactly when the information can be summoned to a set
	of spacetime points, showing how to do so efficiently using a combination
	of teleportation and codeword-stabilized quantum codes. This provides
	a simple and complete description of where and when a qubit can be
	located in spacetime, revealing a remarkable variety of possibilities.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulation is a promising near term application for mesoscale

	quantum systems. Recent experiments in a range of technical platforms
	have demonstrated the basic functionality of quantum simulation applied

	restrict the achievable inter-particle interaction, forming a serious
	constraint on the ability to realize a versatile, programmable, quantum

	sequences of unitary operations that engineer desired effective Hamiltonians
	in the time-domain. The result is a hybrid programmable analog simulator
	permitting a broad class of interacting spin-lattice models to be
	generated starting only with an arbitrary native inter-particle interaction
	and single-qubit addressing. Building on previous work proving that
	universal simulation is possible using both entangling gates and
	single-qubit unitaries, we show how determining the relevant hardware
	"program" of unitary pulses to implement an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian
	on such a simulator can be formulated as a linear program that runs
	in polynomial time and scales efficiently in hardware resources.

	to obtain this, we extend the classical $d$-separation theorem to

	on probabilities can go beyond these conditional independences. For
	example we find that no probabilistic theory predicts perfect correlation
	between three parties using only bipartite common causes. Finally,

	the effect has found applications ranging from probing exciton delocalisation

  abstract = {Quantum information enables dramatic new advantages for computation,

	This naturally raises the fundamental question: what unique resources
	of the quantum world enable the advantages of quantum information?
	There have been many attempts to answer this question, with proposals
	including the hypothetical "quantum parallelism" some associate with
	quantum superposition, the necessity of large amounts of entanglement,
	and much ado about quantum discord. Unfortunately none of these proposals
	have proven satisfactory, and, in particular, none have helped resolve
	outstanding challenges confronting the field. For example, on the
	theoretical side, the most general classes of problems for which
	quantum algorithms might offer an exponential speed-up over classical
	algorithms are poorly understood. On the experimental side, there
	remain significant challenges to designing robust, large-scale quantum
	computers, and an important open problem is to determine the minimal
	physical requirements of a useful quantum computer. A framework identifying
	relevant resources for quantum computation should help clarify these
	issues, for example, by identifying new efficient simulation schemes
	for classes of quantum algorithms and by clarifying the trade-offs
	between the distinct physical requirements for achieving robust quantum
	computation. Here we establish that quantum contextuality, a generalization
	of nonlocality identified by Bell and Kochen-Specker almost 50 years
	ago, is a critical resource for quantum speed-up within the leading
	model for fault-tolerant quantum computation, magic state distillation.
	We prove our results by finding the exact value of the independence
	number in an infinite family of graphs, which is a particular instance
	of an NP-hard problem.},

  abstract = {A comparative classification scheme provides a good basis for several
	approaches to understand proteins, including prediction of relations
	between their structure and biological function. But it remains a
	challenge to combine a classification scheme that describes a protein
	starting from its well organized secondary structures and often involves
	direct human involvement, with an atomary level Physics based approach
	where a protein is fundamentally nothing more than an ensemble of
	mutually interacting carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
	In order to bridge these two complementary approaches to proteins,
	conceptually novel tools need to be introduced. Here we explain how
	the geometrical shape of entire folded proteins can be described
	analytically in terms of a single explicit elementary function that
	is familiar from nonlinear physical systems where it is known as
	the kink-soliton. Our approach enables the conversion of hierarchical
	structural information into a quantitative form that allows for a
	folded protein to be characterized in terms of a small number of
	global parameters that are in principle computable from atomary level
	considerations. As an example we describe in detail how the native
	fold of the myoglobin 1M6C emerges from a combination of kink-solitons
	with a very high atomary level accuracy. We also verify that our
	approach describes longer loops and loops connecting $\alpha$-helices
	with $\beta$-strands, with same overall accuracy.},

  abstract = {In recent work, Benjamin Schumacher and Michael~D. Westmoreland investigate
	a version of quantum mechanics which they call "modal quantum theory"
	but which we prefer to call "discrete quantum theory". This theory
	is obtained by instantiating the mathematical framework of Hilbert
	spaces with a finite field instead of the field of complex numbers.
	This instantiation collapses much the structure of actual quantum
	mechanics but retains several of its distinguishing characteristics
	including the notions of superposition, interference, and entanglement.
	Furthermore, discrete quantum theory excludes local hidden variable
	models, has a no-cloning theorem, and can express natural counterparts
	of quantum information protocols such as superdense coding and teleportation.
	Our first result is to distill a model of discrete quantum computing
	from this quantum theory. The model is expressed using a monadic
	metalanguage built on top of a universal reversible language for
	finite computations, and hence is directly implementable in a language
	like Haskell. In addition to superpositions and invertible linear
	maps, the model includes conventional programming constructs including
	pairs, sums, higher-order functions, and recursion. Our second result
	is to relate this programming model to relational programming, e.g.,
	a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly discrete
	quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming
	except for a small twist that is responsible for all the ``quantum-ness.''
	The twist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several
	alternatives: the answers are combined using an "exclusive" version
	of logical disjunction. In other words, the two branches of a choice
	junction exhibit an "interference" effect: an answer is produced
	from the junction if it occurs in one or the other branch but not
	both.},

  abstract = {It is known that both quantum and classical cellular automata (CA)
	exist that are computationally universal in the sense that they can
	simulate, after appropriate initialization, any quantum or classical
	computation, respectively. Here we introduce a different notion of
	universality: a CA is called physically universal if every transformation
	on any finite region can be (approximately) implemented by the autonomous
	time evolution of the system after the complement of the region has
	been initialized in an appropriate way. We pose the question of whether
	physically universal CAs exist. Such CAs would provide a model of
	the world where the boundary between a physical system and its controller
	can be consistently shifted, in analogy to the Heisenberg cut for
	the quantum measurement problem. We propose to study the thermodynamic
	cost of computation and control within such a model because implementing
	a cyclic process on a microsystem may require a non-cyclic process
	for its controller, whereas implementing a cyclic process on system
	and controller may require the implementation of a non-cyclic process
	on a "meta"-controller, and so on. Physically universal CAs avoid
	this infinite hierarchy of controllers and the cost of implementing
	cycles on a subsystem can be described by mixing properties of the
	CA dynamics. We define a physical prior on the CA configurations
	by applying the dynamics to an initial state where half of the CA
	is in the maximum entropy state and half of it is in the all-zero
	state (thus reflecting the fact that life requires non-equilibrium
	states like the boundary between a hold and a cold reservoir). As
	opposed to Solomonoff's prior, our prior does not only account for
	the Kolmogorov complexity but also for the cost of isolating the
	system during the state preparation if the preparation process is

  abstract = {We propose a (theoretical ;-) model for quantum computation where
	the result can be read out from the time average of the Hamiltonian
	dynamics of a 2-dimensional crystal on a cylinder. The Hamiltonian
	is a spatially local interaction among Wigner-Seitz cells containing
	6 qubits. The quantum circuit that is simulated is specified by the
	initialization of program qubits. As in Margolus' Hamiltonian cellular
	automaton (implementing classical circuits), a propagating wave in
	a clock register controls asynchronously the application of the gates.
	However, in our approach all required initializations are basis states.
	After a while the synchronizing wave is essentially spread around
	the whole crystal. The circuit is designed such that the result is
	available with probability about 1/4 despite of the completely undefined
	computation step. This model reduces quantum computing to preparing
	basis states for some qubits, waiting, and measuring in the computational
	basis. Even though it may be unlikely to find our specific Hamiltonian
	in real solids, it is possible that also more natural interactions
	allow ergodic quantum computing.},

	economics is balanced reciprocity, not the principle of utility maximisation
	that is important in economics more generally. The argument is developed
	by analysing the mathematical Fundamental Theory of Asset Pricing
	with reference to the emergence of mathematical probability in the
	seventeenth century in the context of the ethical assessment of commercial
	contracts. This analysis is undertaken within a framework of Pragmatic
	philosophy and Virtue Ethics. The purpose of the paper is to mitigate
	future financial crises by reorienting financial economics to emphasise
	the objectives of market stability and social cohesion rather than
	individual utility maximisation.},

  abstract = {Simulating quantum circuits using classical computers lets us analyse
	the inner workings of quantum algorithms. The most complete type
	of simulation, strong simulation, is believed to be generally inefficient.
	Nevertheless, several efficient strong simulation techniques are
	known for restricted families of quantum circuits and we develop
	an additional technique in this article. Further, we show that strong
	simulation algorithms perform another fundamental task: solving search
	problems. Efficient strong simulation techniques allow solutions
	to a class of search problems to be counted and found efficiently.
	This enhances the utility of strong simulation methods, known or
	yet to be discovered, and extends the class of search problems known
	to be efficiently simulable. Relating strong simulation to search
	problems also bounds the computational power of efficiently strongly
	simulable circuits; if they could solve all problems in $\mathrm{P}$
	this would imply the collapse of the complexity hierarchy $\mathrm{P}

	computation is experimentally challenging. This thesis develops quantum
	logic synthesis as a paradigm for reducing the resource overhead
	in fault-tolerant quantum computing. The model for error correction
	considered here is the surface code. After developing the theory
	behind general logic synthesis, the resource costs of magic-state
	distillation for the $T = \exp(i \pi (I-Z)/8)$ gate are quantitatively
	analyzed. The resource costs for a relatively new protocol distilling
	multi-qubit Fourier states are calculated for the first time. Four
	different constructions of the fault-tolerant Toffoli gate, including
	two which incorporate error detection, are analyzed and compared.
	The techniques of logic synthesis reduce the cost of fault-tolerant
	quantum computation by one to two orders of magnitude, depending
	on which benchmark is used. Using resource analysis for $T$ gates
	and Toffoli gates, several proposals for constructing arbitrary quantum
	gates are compared, including "Clifford+$T$" sequences, $V$-basis
	sequences, phase kickback, and programmable ancilla rotations. The
	application of arbitrary gates to quantum algorithms for simulating

	a multiple linear regression optimisation algorithm is used to generate

	a high accuracy and delivers good forecasts for the majority of indicators.
	Second, an early-warning mechanism for global financial crises is
	presented, which combines network measures with standard economic
	indicators. From the analysis of the cross-border portfolio investment
	network of long-term debt securities, the proliferation of a wide
	range of over-the-counter-traded financial derivative products, such
	as credit default swaps, can be described in terms of gross-market
	values and notional outstanding amounts, which are associated with
	increased levels of market interdependence and systemic risk. Third,
	considering the flow-network of goods traded between G-20 economies,
	network statistics provide better proxies for key economic measures

  abstract = {The unitary matchgate circuits introduced by Valiant provide an interesting
	class of quantum circuits that are classically efficiently simulatable.
	They were shown by Terhal & DiVincenzo and Knill to be related to
	the physics of non-interacting fermions. The Jordan-Wigner (JW) formalism
	provides an efficient classical simulation of the latter, which turns
	out to be equivalent to the restricted case of circuits of binary
	(2-qubit) matchgates. Valiant's formalism allows further unitary
	gates: in particular we may include arbitrary 1-qubit gates on the
	first qubit line at any stage within a binary matchgate circuit.
	In this note we show how the JW formalism may be extended to provide
	an efficient classical simulation of such extended circuits, and
	we show how the simulability also follows from some elementary Lie
	algebra theory. The essential ingredients have been indicated previously
	by Knill in a condensed and abstract form, and our purpose is to
	make these results explicit and transparent.},

  note = {arXiv:1308.6128v1},
  abstract = {A closed quantum system is defined as completely controllable if an
	arbitrary unitary transformation can be executed using the available
	controls. In practice, control fields are a source of unavoidable
	noise, which has to be suppressed to retain controllability. Can
	one design control fields such that the effect of noise is negligible
	on the time-scale of the transformation? This question is intimately
	related to the fundamental problem of a connection between the computational
	complexity of the control problem and the sensitivity of the controlled
	system to noise. The present study considers a paradigm of control,
	where the Lie-algebraic structure of the control Hamiltonian is fixed,
	while the size of the system increases with the dimension of the
	Hilbert space representation of the algebra. We find two types of
	control tasks, easy and hard. Easy tasks are characterized by a small
	variance of the evolving state with respect to the operators of the
	control operators. They are relatively immune to noise and the control
	field is easy to find. Hard tasks have a large variance, are sensitive
	to noise and the control field is hard to find. The influence of
	noise increases with the size of the system, which is measured by
	the scaling factor $N$ of the largest weight of the representation.
	For fixed time and control field as O(N) for easy tasks and as $O(N^2)$
	for hard tasks. As a consequence, even in the most favorable estimate,
	for large quantum systems, generic noise in the controls dominates
	for a typical class of target transformations, i.e., complete controllability
	is destroyed by noise.},

	We argue that the effective anti-commutators of these measurements,

	are an expedient measure of measurement incompatibility. Based on
	the knowledge of pairwise effective anti-commutators we derive a
	class of entropic uncertainty relations in terms of conditional R\'{e}nyi
	entropies. Our uncertainty relations are formulated in terms of effective
	measures of incompatibility, which can be certified device-independently.

	of these limited quantum computational devices is the understanding
	of whether the verification of the computation within these models
	could be also performed in the restricted scheme. Encoding via blindness
	(a cryptographic protocol for delegated computing) has proven successful
	for the verification of universal quantum computation with a restricted
	verifier. In this paper, we present the adaptation of this approach

  abstract = {This paper is an introduction to relationships between quantum topology
	and quantum computing. We take a foundational approach, showing how
	knots are related not just to braiding and quantum operators, but
	to quantum set theoretical foundations and algebras of fermions.
	We show how the operation of negation in logic, seen as both a value
	and an operator, can generate the fusion algebra for a Majorana fermion,
	a particle that is its own anti-particle and interacts with itself
	either to annihilate itself or to produce itself. We call negation
	in this mode the mark, as it operates on itself to change from marked
	to unmarked states. The mark viewed recursively as a simplest discrete
	dynamical system naturally generates the fermion algebra, the quaternions
	and the braid group representations related to Majorana fermions.
	The paper begins with these fundmentals. They provide a conceptual
	key to many of the models that appear later in the paper. In particular,
	the Fibonacci model for topological quantum computing is seen to
	be based on the fusion rules for a Majorana fermion and these in
	turn are the interaction rules for the mark seen as a logical particle.
	It requires a shift in viewpoint to see that the operator of negation
	can also be seen as a logical value. The quaternions emerge naturally
	from the reentering mark. All these models have their roots in unitary
	representations of the Artin braid group to the quaternions.},

  abstract = {Unphysical particles are commonly ruled out from the solution of physical
	equations, as they fundamentally cannot exist in any real system
	and, hence, cannot be examined experimentally in a direct fashion.
	One of the most celebrated equations that allows unphysical solutions
	is the relativistic Majorana equation\cite{Majorana} which might
	describe neutrinos and other exotic particles beyond the Standard
	Model. The equation's physical solutions, the Majorana fermions,
	are predicted to be their own anti-particles and as a consequence
	they have to be neutrally charged; the charged version however (called
	Majoranon) is, due to charge non-conservation, unphysical and cannot
	exist. On the other hand, charge conservation violation has been
	contemplated in alternative theories associated with higher spacetime
	dimensions or a non-vanishing photon mass; theories whose exotic
	nature makes experimental testing with current technology an impossible
	task. In our work, we present an experimental scheme based on optics
	with which we simulate the dynamics of a Majoranon, involving the
	implementation of unphysical charge conjugation and complex conjugation.
	We show that the internal dynamics of the Majoranon is fundamentally
	different from that of its close cousin, the Dirac particle, to illustrate
	the nature of the unphysical operations. For this we exploit the
	fact that in quantum mechanics the wave function itself is not a
	measurable quantity. Therefore, wave functions of real physical particles,
	in our case Dirac particles with opposite masses, can be superposed
	to a wave function of an unphysical particle, the Majoranon. Our
	results open a new front in the field of quantum simulations of exotic
	phenomena, with possible applications in condensed matter physics,
	topological quantum computing, and testing theories within and beyond
	the Standard Model with existing technology.},

  abstract = {We treat control of several two-level atoms interacting with one mode
	of the electromagnetic field in a cavity. This provides a useful
	model to study pertinent aspects of quantum control in infinite dimensions
	via the emergence of infinite-dimensional system algebras. Hence
	we address problems arising with infinite-dimensional Lie algebras
	and those of unbounded operators. For the models considered, these
	problems can be solved by splitting the set of control Hamiltonians
	into two subsets: The first obeys an abelian symmetry and can be
	treated in terms of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and strongly
	closed subgroups of the unitary group of the system Hilbert space.
	The second breaks this symmetry, and its discussion introduces new
	arguments. Yet, full controllability can be achieved in a strong
	sense: e.g., in a time dependent Jaynes-Cummings model we show that,
	by tuning coupling constants appropriately, every unitary of the
	coupled system (atoms and cavity) can be approximated with arbitrarily
	small error.},

	photons closing the detection loophole (also referred to as the fair
	sampling loophole) were published (Vienna, 2013). From the theoretical
	viewpoint the main distinguishing feature of this long-aspired experiment
	was that the Eberhard inequality was used. Almost simultaneously
	another experiment closing this loophole was performed (Urbana-Champaign,
	2013) and it was based on the Clauser-Horne inequality (for probabilities).
	The aim of this note is to analyze the mathematical and experimental
	equivalence of tests based on the Eberhard inequality and various
	forms on the Clauser-Horne inequality. The structure of the mathematical
	equivalence is nontrivial. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish
	between algebraic and statistical equivalence. Although the tests
	based on these inequalities are algebraically equivalent, they need
	not be equivalent statistically, i.e., theoretically the level of
	statistical significance can drop under transition from one test
	to another (at least for finite samples). Nevertheless, the data
	collected in the Vienna-test implies not only a statistically significant
	violation of the Eberhard inequality, but also of the Clauser-Horne
	inequality (in the ratio-rate form): for both a violation $>60\sigma.$},

  month = {5},
  note = {arXiv:1305.7489v1},
  abstract = {A universal entangler (UE) is a unitary operation which maps all pure
	product states to entangled states. It is known that for a bipartite
	system of particles $1,2$ with a Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$,
	a UE exists when $\min{(d_1,d_2)}\geq 3$ and $(d_1,d_2)\neq (3,3)$.
	It is also known that whenever a UE exists, almost all unitaries
	are UEs; however to verify whether a given unitary is a UE is very
	difficult since solving a quadratic system of equations is NP-hard
	in general. This work examines the existence and construction of
	UEs of bipartite bosonic/fermionic systems whose wave functions sit
	in the symmetric/antisymmetric subspace of $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$.
	The development of a theory of UEs for these types of systems needs
	considerably different approaches from that used for UEs of distinguishable
	systems. This is because the general entanglement of identical particle
	systems cannot be discussed in the usual way due to the effect of
	(anti)-symmetrization which introduces "pseudo entanglement" that
	is inaccessible in practice. We show that, unlike the distinguishable
	particle case, UEs exist for bosonic/fermionic systems with Hilbert
	spaces which are symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$
	if and only if $d\geq 3$ (resp. $d\geq 8$). To prove this we employ
	algebraic geometry to reason about the different algebraic structures
	of the bosonic/fermionic systems. Additionally, due to the relatively
	simple coherent state form of unentangled bosonic states, we are
	able to give the explicit constructions of two bosonic UEs. Our investigation
	provides insight into the entanglement properties of systems of indisitinguishable
	particles, and in particular underscores the difference between the
	entanglement structures of bosonic, fermionic and distinguishable
	particle systems.},

	we have $D^{A\to B}(f)\leq O(Q^{A\to B,*}(f)\cdot m)$. This bound

	on the right hand is present, or the left hand side is $R^{A\to B}(f)$,
	and in which also no entanglement is allowed. In our second contribution
	we investigate the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs.
	We give the first example of a scenario, where quantum proofs lead
	to exponential savings in computing a Boolean function. The previously
	only known separation between the power of quantum and classical
	proofs is in a setting where the input is also quantum. We exhibit
	a partial Boolean function $f$, such that there is a one-way quantum
	communication protocol receiving a quantum proof (i.e., a protocol

  abstract = {Since beginning of the 2008 financial crisis almost half a trillion

	For economies in recession with high unemployment the bail-in tool

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of interaction and coins in public-coin
	quantum interactive proof systems (also called quantum Arthur-Merlin
	games). While prior works focused on classical public coins even
	in the quantum setting, the present work introduces a generalized
	version of quantum Arthur-Merlin games where the public coins can
	be quantum as well: the verifier can send not only random bits, but
	also halves of EPR pairs. First, it is proved that the class of two-turn
	quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum public coins, denoted qq-QAM
	in this paper, does not change by adding a constant number of turns
	of classical interactions prior to the communications of the qq-QAM
	proof systems. This can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the celebrated
	collapse theorem for AM due to Babai. To prove this collapse theorem,
	this paper provides a natural complete problem for qq-QAM: deciding
	whether the output of a given quantum circuit is close to a totally
	mixed state. This complete problem is on the very line of the previous
	studies investigating the hardness of checking the properties related
	to quantum circuits, and is of independent interest. It is further
	proved that the class qq-QAM_1 of two-turn quantum-public-coin quantum
	Arthur-Merlin proof systems with perfect completeness gives new bounds
	for standard well-studied classes of two-turn interactive proof systems.
	Finally, the collapse theorem above is extended to comprehensively
	classify the role of interaction and public coins in quantum Arthur-Merlin
	games: it is proved that, for any constant m>1, the class of problems
	having an m-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin proof system is either equal
	to PSPACE or equal to the class of problems having a two-turn quantum
	Arthur-Merlin game of a specific type, which provides a complete
	set of quantum analogues of Babai's collapse theorem.},

	fractions. Let r be an unknown positive integer. Assume that with
	some constant probability we obtain random positive integers of the
	form x=[ N k/r ] where [.] is either the floor or ceiling of the
	rational number, k is selected uniformly at random from {0,1,...,r-1},
	and N is a parameter that can be chosen. The problem of recovering
	r from such samples occurs precisely in the classical post-processing
	part of Shor's algorithm. The quantum part (quantum phase estimation)
	makes it possible to obtain such samples where r is the order of
	some element a of the unit group of Z_n and n is the number to be
	factored. Shor showed that the continued fraction algorithm can be
	used to efficiently recover r, since if N>2r^2 then k/r appears in
	lowest terms as one of the convergents of x/N due to a standard result
	on continued fractions. We present here an alternative method for
	recovering r based on the Gauss algorithm for lattice basis reduction,
	allowing us to efficiently find the shortest nonzero vector of a
	lattice generated by two vectors. Our method is about as efficient
	as the method based on continued fractions, yet it is much easier
	to understand all the details of why it works.},

	create a ''bridge'' from fragile quanta to the robust, objective
	world of everyday experience? It is now commonly accepted that the
	most promising approach is the Decoherence Theory, based on the system-environment
	paradigm. To explain the observed %redundancy and objectivity of

	drawbacks: i) the entropic information redundancy is motivated by
	a priori purely classical reasoning; ii) there is no answer to the
	basic question: what physical process makes the transition from quantum
	description to classical objectivity possible? Here we prove that
	the necessary and sufficient condition for objective existence of
	a state is the spectrum broadcasting process, which, in particular,
	implies Quantum Darwinism. We first show it in general, using multiple
	environments paradigm, a suitable definition of objectivity, and
	Bohr's notion of non-disturbance, and then on the emblematic example
	for Decoherence Theory: a dielectric sphere illuminated by photons.
	We also apply Perron-Frobenius Theorem to show a faithful, ''decoherence-free''

	be one of the foundational properties of Nature, which opens a ''window''

	postselection scheme in a practical two-dimensional quantum architecture
	that we designed with the goal to optimize the error correction properties,

	that all gates have the same error rates, we obtain a threshold of
	$3.06\times 10^{-4}$ in a local adversarial stochastic noise model,
	which is the highest known error threshold for concatenated codes

	by pointing out a class of basic constraints that the theory itself

	more recent no-go claims and I will argue against the deep significance
	of these results, with a two-fold strategy. First, I will consider
	three results concerning respectively local realism, quantum covariance
	and predictive power in quantum mechanics, and I will try to show
	how controversial the main conditions of the negative theorem turn
	out to be, something that strongly undermines the general relevance
	of these theorems. Second, I will try to discuss what I take to be
	a common feature of these theoretical enterprises, namely that of
	aiming at establishing negative results for quantum mechanics in
	absence of a deeper understanding of the overall ontological content
	and structure of the theory. I will argue that the only way toward

	with finding localised systems in quantum field theory that are useful
	for quantum information. It draws from many well established physical
	theories such as quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, quantum
	optics and Gaussian state quantum information. The results are split
	between three chapters. For the first results, we set-up the basic
	framework for working with quantum fields confined to cavities. By
	considering the real Klein-Gordon field, we describe how to model
	the non-uniform motion of a rigid cavity through spacetime. We employ
	the use of Bogoliubov transformations to describe the effects of
	changing acceleration. The second set of results investigate how
	the Dirac field can be confined to a cavity for quantum information
	purposes. By again considering Bogoliubov transformations, we thoroughly
	investigate how the entanglement shared between two cavities is affected
	by non-uniform motion. It is shown that different types of Dirac
	field states are more robust against motion than others. The final
	results look at using our second notion of localisation, Unruh- DeWitt
	detectors. We investigate how allowing for a "non-point-like" spatial
	profile of the Unruh-DeWitt detector affects how it interacts with
	a quantum field around it. By engineering suitable detector-field
	interactions, we use techniques from symplectic geometry to compute
	the dynamics of a quantum state beyond commonly used perturbation
	theory. There is also a conclusions chapter at the end of the thesis

	quantum correlations of single photons between Alice and Bob. The
	intrinsic bi-partite correlation functions allow key bit to be generated
	through high level communication language i.e. a key bit is directly
	encoded to shared correlation functions not to the state and detection
	of a photon at Bob does not mean key bit. These make the scheme robust
	against intercept-resend attack because Alice and Bob can always
	check the errors in their measurements and reveal the presence of
	Eve in their channel without leaking any key bit information. The
	laser source is located in the middle of Alice and Bob, consists
	of two modes (x,y), relatively random phase-modulated $(\pm \frac{\pi}{2})$
	weak coherent states combined in a perfect 50/50 beam splitter. The
	scheme is strictly relied on the perfect beam splitter and mean photon
	number less than 1, where more than one photon in a coherent pulse
	will introduce more errors in Bob even without the presence of Eve.
	From the percentage of errors in Bob, we can estimate the amount
	of information will be leaked to Eve in the photon-number splitting
	attack. This scheme can preserve the randomness of phase-randomized
	light source for doubling the communication distance as in original
	Ekert's protocol and providing the raw key generation rate a factor
	of 2 higher than weak coherent light protocols.},

  abstract = {Indistinguishable quantum states interfere, but the mere possibility

	imaging concept that relies on the indistinguishability of the possible
	sources of a photon that remains undetected. Our experiment uses
	pair creation in two separate down-conversion crystals. If a pair
	is created in the first crystal, the undetected photon passes the
	sample to be imaged, and its mode is made identical to that of an
	undetected photon created in the second crystal. Because of the pair
	correlation, the phase and amplitude information imprinted on the
	undetected photon is also carried by its brother photon, called the
	signal. Interference of the two signal beams, one arising from each
	crystal, then reveals the image. The photons passing through the
	object are never detected, and the signal photons that are detected
	never interact with the object. We demonstrate the power of the method
	by exhibiting images obtained with signal photons that either cannot
	pass through the object because they would be absorbed, or where
	the phase information would not lead to a pattern. The probe wavelength

	is a quantum system that continuously evolves. We propose a protocol
	that can debug a quantum process by monitoring, but not disturb the
	evolution of the system. This protocol consists of an error detector
	and a debugging strategy. The detector is a projection operator that
	is orthogonal to the anticipated system state at a sequence of time
	points, and the strategy is used to specify these time points. As
	an example, we show how to debug the computational process of quantum
	search using this protocol. By applying the Skolem--Mahler--Lech
	theorem in algebraic number theory, we find an algorithm to construct
	all of the debugging protocols for quantum processes of time independent

	quantum cryp-tography, and quantum computation [1].To date, controlled
	unitary interactions applied to a quantum system, so-called "quantum
	gates", have been the most widely used method to deterministically
	create entanglement [2]. These processes require high-fidelity state
	preparation as well as minimizing the decoherence that inevitably
	arises from coupling between the system and the environment and imperfect
	control of the system parameters. Here, on the contrary, we combine
	unitary processes with engineered dissipation to deterministically
	produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two trapped-ion
	qubits independent of their initial state. While previous works along
	this line involved the application of sequences of multiple time-dependent
	gates [3] or generated entanglement of atomic ensembles dissipatively
	but relied on a measurement record for steady-state entanglement
	[4], we implement the process in a continuous time-independent fashion,
	analogous to optical pumping of atomic states. By continuously driving
	the system towards steady-state, the entanglement is stabilized even
	in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration
	of an entangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards
	dissipative state engineering, dissipative quantum computation, and
	dissipative phase transitions [5-7]. Following this approach, engineered
	coupling to the environment may be applied to a broad range of experimental
	systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed,
	concurrently with this work, an entangled steady state of two superconducting
	qubits was demonstrated using dissipation [8].},

	Isolated qubits can be implemented using current technologies, such

  abstract = {Here Bohmian mechanics is used to explore the dynamics of mixed states,
	often regarded as the result of classical-like ignorance, or incoherence
	inhibiting interference. Because of the nonlinear nature of the Bohmian
	guidance equation, it is shown that the corresponding trajectories
	do not exhibit the behavior expected from a typical context of classical
	ignorance. On the contrary, they preserve their full nonlocal quantum
	signature. This fact is illustrated by means of a simple Young-type
	experiment with incoherent slits, where the lack of interference
	usually involves a classical interpretation in terms of path (which-way)
	knowledge. The experimental evidence of this behavior entails important
	fundamental implications: even if trajectories can be measured, as
	claimed in recent years, they cannot remove uncertainty, which is
	intrinsic to quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which Bob
	wishes to commit a secret bit to Alice. Perfectly secure bit commitment
	has been proven impossible through asynchronous exchange of classical
	and quantum information. Perfect security is however possible by
	restraining the exchange of classical and quantum information to
	suitably chosen relativistic constraints. This requires Alice (and
	Bob) to split into two remote agents performing space-like separated
	classical communication, and in one agent exchanging quantum bits
	with the other party. The duration of the commitment is given by
	the distance between the two remote agents. The original protocol
	requires the quantum communication to happen at a precise location
	and time with respect to the classical communication. We show how
	the protocol can be modified to relax this constraint such that the
	quantum part of the protocol can be performed at any time before
	the actual commitment, making it much more practical. Finally, we
	present an experimental demonstration of this protocol realized with
	a commercial quantum key distribution system and with synchronized
	classical agents located in Geneva and Singapore, yielding a commitment
	time of 15 ms. Our work includes a complete security analysis, accounting

	a link between uncertainty relations and local gauge invariance.
	For quantum systems of finite dimensions our approach provides an

	a small secret key to lock an exponentially longer message by encoding

	protocols are based on random or pseudorandom unitaries which are

	which are useful for locking classical data by employing techniques
	from random matrix theory. We show that successful data locking protocols
	can be constructed from random codewords instead of random bases,
	which very well could be helpful in discovering direct data locking
	codes that are robust to noise in the systems of the legitimate receiver

	We analyze a very large set of configurations for graphs with quasi-quadratic

  abstract = {We present methods that can provide an exponential savings in the
	resources required to perform dynamic parameter estimation using
	quantum systems. The key idea is to merge classical compressive sensing
	techniques with quantum control methods to efficiently estimate time-dependent
	parameters in the system Hamiltonian. We show that incoherent measurement
	bases and, more generally, suitable random measurement matrices can
	be created by performing simple control sequences on the quantum
	system. Since random measurement matrices satisfying the restricted
	isometry property can be used to reconstruct any sparse signal in
	an efficient manner, and many physical processes are approximately
	sparse in some basis, these methods can potentially be useful in
	a variety of applications such as quantum sensing and magnetometry.
	We illustrate the theoretical results throughout the presentation
	with various practically relevant numerical examples.},

  abstract = {We propose a protocol by which entanglement can be extracted repeatedly
	from a quantum field. In analogy with prior work on entanglement
	harvesting, we call this protocol entanglement farming. It consists
	of successively sending pairs of unentangled particles through an
	optical cavity. Using non-perturbative Gaussian methods, we show
	that in certain generic circumstances this protocol drives the cavity
	field towards a non-thermal metastable state. This state of the cavity
	is such that successive pairs of unentangled particles sent through
	the cavity will reliably emerge significantly entangled. We calculate
	thermodynamic aspects of the harvesting process, such as energies
	and entropies, and also the long-term behavior beyond the few-mode
	approximation. Significant for possible experimental realizations
	is the fact that this entangling fixed point state of the cavity
	is reached largely independently of the initial state in which the
	cavity was prepared. Our results suggest that reliable entanglement
	farming on the basis of such a fixed point state should be possible
	also in various other experimental settings, namely with the to-be-entangled
	particles replaced by arbitrary qudits and with the cavity replaced

	is a problem with broad applications, including describing thermal

	and exploring quantum metrology in the presence of noise. The symmetry
	of the dynamics may reflect a symmetry of the fundamental laws of
	nature, a symmetry of a low-energy effective theory, or it may describe
	a practical restriction such as the lack of a reference frame. In
	this paper, we apply some tools of harmonic analysis together with
	ideas from quantum information theory to this problem. The central
	idea is to study the decomposition of quantum operations---in particular,
	states, measurements and channels---into different modes, which we
	call modes of asymmetry. Under symmetric processing, a given mode
	of the input is mapped to the corresponding mode of the output, implying
	that one can only generate a given output if the input contains all

  abstract = {Quantum f-Divergence proposed by Petz (see HiaiMosonyiPetzBeny for
	comprehensive review) is widely studied, especially due to its implication
	to perfect error correction. The present author had proposed a new
	quantum version of "generalized fidelity". This is essentially a
	new version of quantum f-divergence (D_{f}^{max}, below) when f is
	operator monotone decreasing. In the definition, we supposed two
	states are strictly positive. In this paper, the definition is generalized
	to include operator convex function f and, to states which may have
	null eigenspace. Not only the definition, also the explicit formula
	for D_{f}^{max}({\rho}||{\sigma}) when {\rho} and {\sigma} have null
	eigenspaces is given, and several properties of the quantity is studied
	(convexity, monotonicity by CPTP maps.) Also, the condition D_{f}^{max}({\rho}||{\sigma})=D_{f}^{max}({\Lambda}({\rho})||{\Lambda}({\sigma})),
	where {\Lambda} is CPTP map, is studied. As is well-known, the analogous
	condition for D_{f} implied reversibility of {\Lambda}, or "sufficiency"
	of the map {\Lambda}. D_{f}^{max}-version of the condition gives
	another type of "sufficiency" property of {\Lambda}.},

  note = {arXiv:1312.5031v1},
  abstract = {Quantum mechanics, which has agreed with every experimental test,
	predicts superposition of position states even for macroscopic objects.
	Because of the massiveness, such states might have a key to investigate
	both quantum measurement problem and quantum gravity. Recently, the
	use of quasi-freely suspended mirror combined with a laser field
	was proposed to prepare such states. One of the key milestones for
	the quantum-optomechanical effects such as the generation of the
	entanglement state and a squeezed state of light is the observation
	of quantum back-action, which identifies the connection between the
	objects and quantumness of the light. Until now, this effect has
	been observed below the meso-scopic mass scale. However, it has not
	been observed yet in the macroscopic scale beyond Planck mass. This
	is partially due to a technical limitation-the radiation pressure
	of light will expose a free mass to instability such as anti-torsional
	spring effect. Also, there is the fundamental compromise between
	tolerance for the instability and sensitivity; sufficient tolerance
	with firm suspension makes the mass differ from free mass, and this
	results in increase of a thermal fluctuating force. Here we describe
	using a triangular optical cavity to overcome these limitations and
	observation of quantum back-action imposed on a suspended 5-mg mirror.
	The origin of quantum back-action is the momentum transfered to the
	mirror by light on its reflection. For the coherent light, the photon
	number fluctuates according to a Poisson distribution and this fluctuation
	gives the radiation pressure fluctuation. The pendulum mode excited
	by this force fluctuation was observed. Our result paves the way
	to the generation of macroscopic entangled states and also has possibility
	to test a role of gravity for solving the quantum measurement problem.},

	To this end, we utilize the overlap mapping developed by Van den
	Nest, D\"ur, and Briegel [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 117207 (2007)] and
	its interpretation through measurement-based quantum computation
	(MBQC). We specify an algorithmic domain, on which the proposed algorithm

	of the approximation. We show that the proposed algorithm does a
	nontrivial task, which would be intractable on any classical computer,
	by showing the problem solvable by the proposed quantum algorithm
	are BQP-complete. In the construction of the BQP-complete problem
	coupling strengths and magnetic fields take complex values. However,
	the Ising models that are of central interest in statistical physics
	and computer science consist of real coupling strengths and magnetic
	fields. Thus we extend the algorithmic domain of the proposed algorithm
	to such a real physical parameter region and calculate the approximation
	scale explicitly. We found that the overlap mapping and its MBQC
	interpretation improves the approximation scale exponentially compared
	to a straightforward constant depth quantum algorithm. On the other
	hand, the proposed quantum algorithm also provides us a partial evidence

	interest due to the recent advances in the control and manipulations
	of systems at the quantum level. Recently, an interferometric scheme
	for the detection of the characteristic function of the work distribution
	following a time-dependent process has been proposed [L. Mazzola
	{\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110} 230602 (2013)]. There, it
	was demonstrated that the work statistics of a quantum system undergoing
	a process can be reconstructed by effectively mapping the characteristic
	function of work on the state of an ancillary qubit. Here, we expand
	that work in two important directions. We first apply the protocol
	to an interesting specific physical example consisting of a superconducting
	qubit dispersively coupled to the field of a microwave resonator,
	thus enlarging the class of situations for which our scheme would
	be key in the task highlighted above. We then account for the interaction
	of the system with an additional one (which might embody an environment),
	and generalise the protocol accordingly.},

	cryptographic quality output security, tolerating a constant level

	quantum information in a quantum harmonic oscillator. This proposal
	exploits multi-photon driven dissipative processes to encode quantum
	information in logical bases composed of Schr\"odinger cat states.
	More precisely, we consider two schemes. In a first scheme, a two-photon
	driven dissipative process is used to stabilize a logical qubit basis
	of two-component Schr\"odinger cat states. While such a scheme ensures
	a protection of the logical qubit against the photon dephasing errors,
	the prominent error channel of single-photon loss induces bit-flip
	type errors that cannot be corrected. Therefore, we consider a second
	scheme based on a four-photon driven dissipative process which leads
	to the choice of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states as the logical
	qubit. Such a logical qubit can be protected against single-photon
	loss by continuous photon number parity measurements. Next, applying
	some specific Hamiltonians, we provide a set of universal quantum
	gates on the encoded qubits of each of the two schemes. In particular,
	we illustrate how these operations can be rendered fault-tolerant
	with respect to various decoherence channels of participating quantum
	systems. Finally, we also propose experimental schemes based on quantum
	superconducting circuits and inspired by methods used in Josephson
	parametric amplification, which should allow to achieve these driven

	survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much
	(sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers.
	Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This
	is the situation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine
	if quantum states or operations do what they are supposed to do,
	based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also
	consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such
	as states or operations. We survey known bounds on testing various

	that this optimization problem is the dual of a geometric programming

	the number of variables grows linearly with the input size. Second,
	the objective function is linear in the input parameters and the

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss some aspects of the theory of wave packets.
	We consider a popular non-covariant Gaussian model used in various
	applications and show that it predicts too slow a longitudinal dispersion
	rate for relativistic particles. We revise this approach by considering
	a covariant model of Gaussian wave packets, and examine our results
	by inspecting a wave packet of arbitrary form. A general formula
	for the time dependence of the dispersion of a wave packet of arbitrary
	form is found. Finally, we give a transparent interpretation of the
	disappearance of the wave function over time due to the dispersion
	--- a feature often considered undesirable, but which is unavoidable
	for wave packets. We find, starting from simple examples, proceeding
	with their generalizations and finally by considering the continuity
	equation, that the integral over time of both the flux and probability
	densities are asymptotically proportional to the factor 1/L^2 in
	the rest frame of the wave packet, just as in the case of an ensemble
	of classical particles.},

  note = {arXiv:1311.3495v1},
  abstract = {Why do correlations between the results of measurements performed
	on physical systems violate Bell and non-contextuality inequalities
	up to some specific limits? The answer may follow from the observation
	that in quantum theory, unlike in other theories, whenever there
	is an experiment to measure $A$ simultaneously with $B$, another
	to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to measure $A$ with $C$, there
	is always an experiment to measure all of them simultaneously. This
	property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly irrelevant
	restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which, surprisingly,
	explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental scenarios.
	An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum quantum
	violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally
	that the E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the
	Bell-CHSH inequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum
	theory. For that, we use the result of an independent experiment
	testing a specific non-contextuality inequality. We perform both
	experiments: the Bell-CHSH inequality experiment on polarization
	entangled states of pairs of photons in Stockholm and, to demonstrate
	independence, the non-contextuality inequality experiment on single
	photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The observed results
	provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle determines
	the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical super-quantum
	violations for either experiment would violate the E principle. This
	supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental
	limitation of nature. If this is true, much of quantum theory trivially
	follow from merely taking the E principle to be a fundamental truth,
	and various information-theoretic postulates are also simplified
	and/or strengthened.},

  abstract = {Quantum tomography requires repeated measurements of many copies of
	the physical system, all prepared by a source in the unknown state.
	In the limit of very many copies measured, the often-used maximum-likelihood
	(ML) method for converting the gathered data into an estimate of
	the state works very well. For smaller data sets, however, it often
	suffers from problems of rank deficiency in the estimated state.
	For many systems of relevance for quantum information processing,
	the preparation of a very large number of copies of the same quantum
	state is still a technological challenge, which motivates us to look
	for estimation strategies that perform well even when there is not

	for quantum states. We demonstrate that, for the case of tomography
	of a single qubit, our estimator significantly outperforms the ML
	estimator for small number of copies of the state measured. Our estimator

	Using topological methods, we classify the possible joint evolutions

  abstract = {Continuous-time quantum error correction (CTQEC) is an approach to
	protecting quantum information from noise in which both the noise
	and the error correcting operations are treated as processes that
	are continuous in time. This chapter investigates CTQEC based on
	continuous weak measurements and feedback from the point of view
	of the subsystem principle, which states that protected quantum informtion
	is contained in a subsystem of the Hilbert space. We study how to
	approach the problem of constructing CTQEC protocols by looking at
	the evolution of the state of the system in an encoded basis in which
	the subsystem containing the protected information is explicit. This
	point of view allows us to reduce the problem to that of protecting
	a known state, and to design CTQEC procedures from protocols for
	the protection of a single qubit. We show how previously studied
	CTQEC schemes with both direct and indirect feedback can be obtained
	from strategies for the protection of a single qubit via weak measurements
	and weak unitary operations. We also review results on the performance
	of CTQEC with direct feedback in cases of Markovian and non-Markovian
	decoherence, where we have shown that due to the existence of a Zeno
	regime in non-Markovian dynamics, the performance of CTQEC can exhibit
	a quadratic improvement if the time resolution of the weak error-correcting
	operations is high enough to reveal the non-Markovian character of
	the noise process.},

	entropy term that measures "distance" between the portfolio holdings
	and the market capital distribution, and another entropy term that
	can be controlled by the trader by choosing a suitable strategy.
	The first aids growth in the portfolio value, and the second poses
	as relative risk of being too far from the market. We give several
	explicit controls of the third term that allows one to outperform
	a diverse volatile market in the long run. Named energy-entropy portfolios,
	these strategies work in both discrete and continuous time, and require
	essentially no probabilistic or structural assumptions. They are
	well-suited to analyze a hierarchical portfolio of portfolios and
	attribute relative risk and reward to different levels of the hierarchy.
	We also consider functionally generated portfolios (introduced by
	Fernholz) in the case of two assets and the binary tree model and

  abstract = {This thesis is a compilation of research in relativistic quantum information
	theory, and research in quantum reference frames. The research in
	the former category provides a fundamental construction of quantum
	information theory of localised qubits in curved spacetimes. For
	example, this concerns quantum experiments on free-space photons
	and electrons in the vicinity of the Earth. From field theory a description
	of localised qubits that traverse classical trajectories in curved
	spacetimes is obtained, for photons and massive spin-1/2 fermions.
	The equations governing the evolution of the two-dimensional quantum
	state and its absolute phase are determined. Quantum information
	theory of these qubits is then developed. The Stern-Gerlach measurement
	formalism for massive spin-1/2 fermions is also derived from field
	theory. In the latter category of research, the process of changing
	reference frames is considered for the case where the reference frames
	are quantum systems. As part of this process, it is shown that decoherence
	is necessarily induced on any quantum system described relative to
	these frames. This process is explored using examples involving quantum
	reference frames for phase and orientation. Quantifying the effect
	of changing quantum reference frames provides a theoretical description

  abstract = {Can quantum mechanics help us in building intelligent robots and agents?
	One of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the
	capacity to learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for
	agents to learn in any real-life situation is the size and complexity
	of the corresponding task environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space
	of possible strategies, learning is typically slow. Even for a moderate
	task environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond
	to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only
	a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope
	with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that quantum
	physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning
	as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large
	class of quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost
	in their active learning efficiency over their classical analogues.
	This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving

  abstract = {We investigate the behavior of the recently proposed quantum Google
	algorithm, or quantum PageRank, in large complex networks. Applying
	the quantum algorithm to a part of the real World Wide Web, we find
	that the algorithm is able to univocally reveal the underlying scale-free
	topology of the network and to clearly identify and order the most
	relevant nodes (hubs) of the graph according to their importance
	in the network structure. Moreover, our results show that the quantum
	PageRank algorithm generically leads to changes in the hierarchy
	of nodes. In addition, as compared to its classical counterpart,
	the quantum algorithm is capable to clearly highlight the structure
	of secondary hubs of the network, and to partially resolve the degeneracy
	in importance of the low lying part of the list of rankings, which
	represents a typical shortcoming of the classical PageRank algorithm.
	Complementary to this study, our analysis shows that the algorithm
	is able to clearly distinguish scale-free networks from other widespread
	and important classes of complex networks, such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
	networks and hierarchical graphs. We show that the ranking capabilities
	of the quantum PageRank algorithm are related to an increased stability
	with respect to a variation of the damping parameter $\alpha$ that
	appears in the Google algorithm, and to a more clearly pronounced
	power-law behavior in the distribution of importance among the nodes,
	as compared to the classical algorithm. Finally, we study to which

	We demonstrate that quantum systems in the eigenstates of Pauli group

	Pauli group quantum measurements are capable of revealing whether

	system. Whenever a mathematical proposition is logically independent

	with the proposition gives random outcomes. This allows for an experimental

  note = {arXiv:1309.0621v2},
  abstract = {We propose and study a model of a quantum memory that features self-correcting
	properties and a lifetime growing arbitrarily with system size at
	non-zero temperature. This is achieved by locally coupling a 2D L
	x L toric code to a 3D bath of bosons hopping on a cubic lattice.
	When the stabilizer operators of the toric code are coupled to the
	displacement operator of the bosons, we solve the model exactly via
	a polaron transformation and show that the energy penalty to create
	anyons grows linearly with L. When the stabilizer operators of the
	toric code are coupled to the bosonic density operator, we use perturbation
	theory to show that the energy penalty for anyons scales with ln(L).
	For a given error model, these energy penalties lead to a lifetime
	of the stored quantum information growing respectively exponentially
	and polynomially with L. Furthermore, we show how to choose an appropriate
	coupling scheme in order to hinder the hopping of anyons (and not
	only their creation) with energy barriers that are of the same order
	as the anyon creation gaps. We argue that a toric code coupled to
	a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet realizes our model in its low-energy
	sector. Finally, we discuss the delicate issue of the stability of
	topological order in the presence of perturbations. While we do not
	derive a rigorous proof of topological order, we present heuristic
	arguments suggesting that topological order remains intact when perturbative
	operators acting on the toric code spins are coupled to the bosonic
	environment.},

	Quantumness is here intended in the sense of minimum average disturbance

	focus on local complete von Neumann measurements as cause of the
	disturbance, and, later on, on the trace-distance as quantifier of

	defined notions of quantumness of correlations. We prove that a large
	class of quantifiers of the quantumness of correlations are entanglement
	monotones for pure bipartite states. In particular, we define an
	entanglement of disturbance for pure states, for which we give an
	analytical expression. Such a measure coincides with negativity and
	concurrence for the case of two qubits. We compute general bounds
	on disturbance for both single states and ensembles, and consider
	several examples, including the uniform Haar ensemble of pure states,
	and pairs of qubit states. Finally, we show that the notion of ensemble
	quantumness of correlations is most relevant in quantum data hiding.

  abstract = {It is currently unknown whether the laws of physics permit time travel
	into the past. While general relativity indicates the theoretical
	possibility of causality violation, it is now widely accepted that
	a theory of quantum gravity must play an essential role in such cases.
	As a striking example, the logical paradoxes usually associated with
	causality violation can be resolved by quantum effects. We ask whether
	the explicit construction of a theory that allows causality violation
	might in turn teach us something about quantum gravity. Taking the
	toy model of Deutsch as a starting point, in Part I we argue that,
	despite being a nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics, the
	model does not imply superluminal signalling and its predictions
	can be operationally verified by experimenters within an appropriate
	ontological setting. In Part II we show that the model can be directly
	applied to scalar quantum fields, provided the fields are sent back
	in time by an amount much larger than the coherence time of the wavepackets.
	We propose a generalisation of the model that lifts this constraint
	and recovers the predictions of standard quantum field theory when
	the size of the temporal jump is much smaller than the coherence
	time of the wavepackets. Finally, we discuss an extension of the
	model to ordinary gravitational time dilation. The resulting model
	generalises and extends earlier work on the topic and can be tested
	experimentally using current technology.},

  abstract = {Phenomena inherent to quantum theory on curved space-time, such as
	Hawking radiation, are typically assumed to be only relevant at extreme
	physical conditions: at high energies and in strong gravitational
	fields. Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence
	of weak gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads
	to universal decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation
	induces a universal coupling between internal degrees-of-freedom
	and the centre-of-mass of a composite particle and we show that the
	resulting entanglement causes the particle's position to decohere.
	We derive the decoherence timescale and show that the weak time dilation
	on Earth is already sufficient to decohere micro-scale objects. No
	coupling to an external environment is necessary, thus even completely
	isolated composite systems will decohere on curved space-time. In
	contrast to gravitational collapse models, no modification of quantum
	theory is assumed. General relativity therefore can account for the
	emergence of classicality and the effect can in principle be tested
	in future matter wave experiments with large molecules or with trapped
	microspheres.},

	On the other hand, we exhibit a class of channels for which entanglement
	gives an advantage over the classical setting if the number of receivers
	is fixed. The second problem we consider features multiple collaborating
	senders and one receiver. Classically, cooperation between the senders
	might allow them to communicate on average more bits than the sum

	an improved random source. Perhaps surprisingly, a single source
	of randomness cannot be amplified at all classically. However, the
	situation is different if one considers correlations allowed by quantum
	mechanics as an extra resource. Here we present a protocol that amplifies
	Santha-Vazirani sources arbitrarily close to deterministic into fully
	random sources. The protocol is device independent, depending only
	on the observed statistics of the devices and on the validity of
	the no-signaling principle between different devices. It improves
	previously-known protocols in two respects. First the protocol is
	tolerant to noise so that even noisy quantum-mechanical systems give
	rise to good devices for the protocol. Second it is simpler, being
	based on the violation of a four-party Bell inequality and on the
	XOR as a hash function. As a technical tool we prove a new de Finetti
	theorem where the subsystems are selected from a Santha-Vazirani
	source.},

	One promising potential implementation is to use superconducting
	quantum bits in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture.
	There, the low energy states of a nonlinear electronic oscillator
	are isolated and addressed as a qubit. These qubits are capacitively
	coupled to the modes of a microwave-frequency transmission line resonator
	which serves as a quantum communication bus. Microwave electrical
	pulses are applied to the resonator to manipulate or measure the
	qubit state. State control is calibrated using diagnostic sequences
	that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the resonator with
	the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly, useful
	for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits
	coupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another
	via the exchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase
	gate mediated by this interaction can deterministically entangle
	its targets, and is used to generate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit
	GHZ states. These three-qubit states are of particular interest because
	they redundantly encode quantum information. They are the basis of
	the quantum repetition code prototypical of more sophisticated schemes
	required for quantum computation. Using a three-qubit Toffoli gate,
	this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct either bit- or
	phase-flip errors. Despite observing the expected behavior, the overall
	fidelity is low because of decoherence. A superior implementation
	of cQED replaces the transmission-line resonator with a three-dimensional
	box mode, increasing lifetimes by an order of magnitude. In-situ
	qubit frequency control is enabled with control lines, which are
	used to fully characterize and control the system Hamiltonian.},

	as well as being in a local thermal state, the system is uncorrelated
	with the reference. We argue that this is necessary in order to apply
	standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction between
	a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition
	for relative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an

	is state-independent, reflecting the structure of invariant subspaces,
	like energy shells, and the relative sizes of system and environment;
	the second depends on the initial correlations between reference,
	system and environment, measured in terms of conditional entropies.
	Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large environment
	is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if, initially,
	the reference was not highly correlated with the system and environment.
	Our statement makes this intuition precise, and we show that in many

  abstract = {In this work we develop a formalism for describing localised quanta
	for a real-valued Klein-Gordon field in a one-dimensional box $[0,
	R]$. We quantise the field using non-stationary local modes which,
	at some arbitrarily chosen initial time, are completely localised
	within the left or the right side of the box. In this concrete set-up
	we directly face the problems inherent to a notion of local field
	excitations, usually thought of as elementary particles. Specifically,
	by computing the Bogoliubov coefficients relating local and standard
	(global) quantizations, we show that the local quantisation yields
	a Fock space $\mathfrak F^L$ which is unitarily inequivalent to the
	standard one $\mathfrak F^G$. In spite of this, we find that the
	local creators and annihilators remain well defined in the global
	Fock space $\mathfrak F^G$, and so do the local number operators
	associated to the left and right partitions of the box. We end up
	with a useful mathematical toolbox to analyse and characterise local
	features of quantum states in $\mathfrak F^G$. Specifically, an analysis
	of the global vacuum state $|0_G\rangle\in\mathfrak F^G$ in terms
	of local number operators shows, as expected, the existence of entanglement
	between the left and right regions of the box. The local vacuum $|0_L\rangle\in\mathfrak
	F^L$, on the contrary, has a very different character. It is neither
	cyclic nor separating and displays no entanglement. Further analysis
	shows that the global vacuum also exhibits a distribution of local
	excitations reminiscent, in some respects, of a thermal bath. We
	discuss how the mathematical tools developed herein may open new
	ways for the analysis of fundamental problems in local quantum field
	theory.},

	combination of pure states, at most one of which has non-zero three-tangle.
	We construct an upper bound on the three tangle using these ensembles
	and a non-uniform continuity bound for any non-negative convex function
	of density matrices. The existence of such ensembles also motivates
	the definition of the best W-class approximation (BWA) of a density
	matrix, a natural generalization of the best separable approximation
	(BSA) introduced by Lewenstein and Sanpera. By analogy with the BSA,
	we prove that any three-qubit density matrix has a unique decomposition
	in terms of its BWA and a pure state with possibly non-zero three-tangle.
	The upper bound may be computed with a cost linear in the rank d
	of the density matrix and has accuracy comparable to a steepest descent
	algorithm for the convex roof whose cost scales as $d^8 \log d$.
	We compare the upper bound to a lower bound algorithm given by Eltschka
	and Siewert for the three-tangle, and find that on random rank-two
	three-qubit density matrices, the difference between the upper and
	lower bounds is 0.14 on average. We also find that the three-tangle

  abstract = {The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence of
	superposition states, where an object appears to be in different
	situations at the same time. The existence of such states has been
	previously tested with small objects, such as atoms, ions, electrons
	and photons (Zoller et al 2005 Eur. Phys. J. D 36 203â28), and
	even with molecules (Arndt et al 1999 Nature 401 680â2). More recently,
	it has been shown that it is possible to create superpositions of
	collections of photons (DelÃ©glise et al 2008 Nature 455 510â14),
	atoms (Hammerer et al 2008 arXiv:0807.3358) or Cooper pairs (Friedman
	et al 2000 Nature 406 43â6). Very recent progress in optomechanical
	systems may soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger
	objects, such as micro-sized mirrors or cantilevers (Marshall et
	al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 130401; Kippenberg and Vahala 2008 Science
	321 1172â6; Marquardt and Girvin 2009 Physics 2 40; Favero and
	Karrai 2009 Nature Photon. 3 201â5), and thus to test quantum mechanical
	phenomena at larger scales. Here we propose a method to cool down
	and create quantum superpositions of the motion of sub-wavelength,
	arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped inside a high-finesse
	cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally suited for the
	smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under low-vacuum
	pressures (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001 Nature 406 1092â101)
	and optically behave as dielectric objects (Ashkin and Dziedzic 1987
	Science 235 1517â20). This opens up the possibility of testing
	the quantum nature of living organisms by creating quantum superposition
	states in very much the same spirit as the original SchrÃ¶dinger's
	cat 'gedanken' paradigm (SchrÃ¶dinger 1935 Naturwissenschaften 23
	807â12, 823â8, 844â9). We anticipate that our paper will be
	a starting point for experimentally addressing fundamental questions,
	such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.},

	decreases exponentially with the number of photons in the N00N state,
	often leading to the conclusion that N00N states are unsuitable for

	super-resolution interference. Although both provide the same increase
	in spatial frequency, the visibility of the classical fringes decreases
	exponentially with the number of detected photons, while the visibility
	of our experimentally measured N00N-state super-resolution fringes
	remains approximately constant with N. Our implementation of the

	and error correction will be required to scale AQC to large problem
	sizes. Previous works have established at least two different techniques
	for error suppression in AQC. In this paper we derive a dynamical
	model for describing the dynamics of encoded AQC and show that previous
	constructions for error suppression can be unified with this dynamical
	model. In addition the model clarifies the mechanisms of error suppression
	and allow identification of its weaknesses. In the second half of
	the paper we utilize our description of non-equilibrium dynamics
	in encoded AQC to construct methods for error correction in AQC by
	cooling local degrees of freedom (qubits). While this is shown to
	be possible in general, we also identify the key challenge to this
	approach: the requirement of high-weight Hamiltonians. Finally, from
	a many-body quantum dynamics perspective, our results demonstrate
	how utilizing the quantum coding formalism can facilitate the dynamical
	analysis of open, many-body quantum systems. This work is a companion
	paper to "Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum
	computation I: techniques and challenges", which provides a quantum
	information perspective on the techniques and limitations of error
	suppression and correction in AQC. In this paper we couch the same
	results within a dynamical framework, which allows for detailed analysis
	of the non-equilibrium dynamics of error suppression and correction
	in encoded AQC.},

  abstract = {Infrastructures are group-like objects that make their appearance
	in arithmetic geometry in the study of computational problems related
	to number fields and function fields over finite fields. The most
	prominent computational tasks of infrastructures are the computation
	of the circumference of the infrastructure and the generalized discrete
	logarithms. Both these problems are not known to have efficient classical
	algorithms for an arbitrary infrastructure. Our main contributions
	are polynomial time quantum algorithms for one-dimensional infrastructures
	that satisfy certain conditions. For instance, these conditions are
	always fulfilled for infrastructures obtained from number fields
	and function fields, both of unit rank one. Since quadratic number
	fields give rise to such infrastructures, this algorithm can be used
	to solve Pell's equation and the principal ideal problem. In this
	sense we generalize Hallgren's quantum algorithms for quadratic number
	fields, while also providing a polynomial speedup over them. Our
	more general approach shows that these quantum algorithms can also
	be applied to infrastructures obtained from complex cubic and totally
	complex quartic number fields. Our improved way of analyzing the
	performance makes it possible to show that these algorithms succeed
	with constant probability independent of the problem size. In contrast,
	the lower bound on the success probability due to Hallgren decreases
	as the fourth power of the logarithm of the circumference. Our analysis
	also shows that fewer qubits are required. We also contribute to
	the study of infrastructures, and show how to compute efficiently
	within infrastructures.},

	At microwave frequencies, very strong photon-photon interactions
	have been demonstrated. Here however, the single-photon detector
	has been elusive due to the low energy of the microwave photon. In
	this article, we present a realistic proposal for quantum nondemolition
	measurements of a single propagating microwave photon. The detector
	design is built on a of chain of artificial atoms connected through
	circulators which break time-reversal symmetry, making both signal
	and probe photons propagate in one direction only. Our analysis is
	based on the theory of cascaded quantum systems and quantum trajectories

	is the following variant of the problem: given a set of projectors
	of rank 1, acting non-trivially on k qubits out of n qubits, such
	that each qubit appears in at most s projectors, decide whether there
	exists a quantum state in the null space of all the projectors. Let
	f*(k) be the maximal integer s such that every (k,s)-QSAT instance

	by definition the answer is "satisfiable". But, by relaxing the conditions
	slightly, we show that (k,f*(k)+2)-QSAT is QMA_1-hard, for k >=15.
	This is a quantum analogue of a classical result by Kratochv\'il
	et al. [KST93]. We use the term "an almost sudden jump" to stress
	that the complexity of (k,f*(k)+1)-QSAT is open, where the jump in
	the classical complexity is known to be sudden. We present an implication

	lectures can often be separated into two classes. In the first class
	you get to know Schroedinger's equation and find the form and dynamics
	of simple physical systems (square well, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen
	atom); most calculations are analytic and inspired by calculations
	originally done in the 1920s and 1930s. In the second class you learn
	about large systems such as molecular structures, crystalline solids,
	or lattice models; these calculations are usually so complicated
	that it is difficult for the student to understand them in all detail.
	This lecture tries to bridge the gap between simple analytic calculations
	and complicated large-scale computations. We will revisit most of
	the problems encountered in introductory quantum mechanics, focusing
	on computer implementations for finding analytical as well as numerical
	solutions and their visualization. Most of these calculations are
	too complicated to be done by hand. Even relatively simple problems,
	such as two interacting particles in a one-dimensional trap, do not
	have analytic solutions and require the use of computers for their
	solution and visualization. More complex problems scale exponentially
	with the number of degrees of freedom, and make the use of large
	computer simulations unavoidable. The course is taught using the
	Mathematica programming language; however, the concepts presented
	are readily translated to any other programming language.},

	relation between pairs of discrete observables (Nature Physics 6,

	false steering inequalities, due in part to the fact that these new
	uncertainty relations depend explicitly on the state being measured.
	By considering the assumptions that enter into the development of
	a steering inequality, we derive correct steering inequalities from
	these improved uncertainty relations and find that they are identical
	to ones already developed (Phys. Rev. A, 87, 062103 (2013)).},

	and involves a slightly elaborated Stern-Gerlach setup. The "special
	state" theory is conservative with respect to quantum mechanics,
	but radical with respect to statistical mechanics, in particular
	regarding the arrow of time. In this article background material
	is given on both quantum measurement and statistical mechanics aspects.
	For example, it is shown that future boundary conditions would not
	contradict experience, indicating that the fundamental equal-a-priori-probability
	assumption at the foundations of statistical mechanics is far too
	strong (since future conditioning reduces the class of allowed states).
	The test is based on a feature of this theory that was found necessary
	in order to recover standard (Born) probabilities in quantum measurements.
	Specifically, certain systems should have "noise" whose amplitude
	follows the long-tailed Cauchy distribution. This distribution is
	marked by the occasional occurrence of extremely large signals as
	well as a non-self-averaging property. The proposed test is a variant
	of the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which protocols are devised, some
	of which will require the presence of this noise, some of which will
	not. The likely observational schemes would involve the distinction
	between detection and non-detection of that "noise". The signal to
	be detected (or not) would be either single photons in the visible
	and UV range or electric fields (and related excitations) in the
	neighborhood of the ends of the magnets.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical studies show that decoherence process can enhance
	transport efficiency in quantum systems. This effect is known as
	environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). The role of ENAQT
	in optimal quantum transport is well investigated, however, it is
	less known how robust ENAQT is with respect to variations in the
	system or its environment characteristic. Toward answering this question,
	we simulated excitonic energy transfer in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)
	photosynthetic complex. We found that ENAQT is robust with respect
	to many relevant parameters of environmental interactions and Frenkel-exciton
	Hamiltonian including reorganization energy, bath frequency cutoff,
	temperature, and initial excitations, dissipation rate, trapping
	rate, disorders, and dipole moments orientations. Our study suggests
	that the ENAQT phenomenon can be exploited in robust design of highly
	efficient quantum transport systems.},

  abstract = {Quantum error-correction codes would protect an arbitrary state of
	a multi-qubit register against decoherence-induced errors, but their
	implementation is an outstanding challenge for the development of
	large-scale quantum computers. A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium
	state of a simple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode
	in the presence of decoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished
	this goal using measurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is
	to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate
	the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register
	of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is
	achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which combines continuous
	drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the
	two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous
	feedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the
	stabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and
	stabilizing states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional,
	measurement-based schemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively
	uses engineered dissipation to fight decoherence, obviating the need
	for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors, simplifying
	implementation. Instead the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian
	such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives
	and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block state
	for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, broadly
	applicable to a variety of physical systems as demonstrated by a
	concurrent publication with trapped ion qubits, will be an essential
	tool for the implementation of quantum-error correction.},

	observables realized by independent experiments on identically prepared

	of sufficient number of ancilla qubits, QST can be performed in a
	single measurement using a procedure known as ancilla assisted quantum
	state tomography (AAQST). It has also been shown earlier that, the
	complete set of orthonormal states required for QPT can be encoded
	on to various subspaces of a larger Liouville space provided by ancilla
	qubits. In this procedure, known as ancilla assisted process tomography
	(AAPT), a single QST suffices to perform QPT. Here we combine AAQST
	with AAPT to realize `single-shot QPT' (SSPT), a procedure to characterize
	a general quantum process in a single collective measurement of a
	set of system-ancilla observables. We also demonstrate experimental
	SSPT by characterizing several single-qubit processes using a three-qubit

	process, greatly increasing the efficiency. This gain comes at the

  note = {arXiv:1311.2534v1},
  abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) is required for a practical quantum
	computer because of the fragile nature of quantum information. In
	QEC, information is redundantly stored in a large Hilbert space and
	one or more observables must be monitored to reveal the occurrence
	of an error, without disturbing the information encoded in an unknown
	quantum state. Such observables, typically multi-qubit parities such
	as <XXXX>, must correspond to a special symmetry property inherent
	to the encoding scheme. Measurements of these observables, or error
	syndromes, must also be performed in a quantum non-demolition (QND)
	way and faster than the rate at which errors occur. Previously, QND
	measurements of quantum jumps between energy eigenstates have been
	performed in systems such as trapped ions, electrons, cavity quantum
	electrodynamics (QED), nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, and superconducting
	qubits. So far, however, no fast and repeated monitoring of an error
	syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum jumps of a
	possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave
	cavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity
	is just the error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme
	for a hardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr\"{o}dinger
	cat states in a harmonic oscillator. We demonstrate the projective
	nature of this measurement onto a parity eigenspace by observing
	the collapse of a coherent state onto even or odd cat states. The
	measurement is fast compared to the cavity lifetime, has a high single-shot
	fidelity, and has a 99.8% probability per single measurement of leaving
	the parity unchanged. In combination with the deterministic encoding
	of quantum information in cat states realized earlier, our demonstrated
	QND parity tracking represents a significant step towards implementing
	an active system that extends the lifetime of a quantum bit.},

	entanglement measure of Christandl and Winter leads to the conclusion
	that the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive
	function of a tensor product of any two quantum channels. More importantly,
	this new subadditivity inequality, along with prior results of Christandl,
	Winter, et al., establishes the squashed entanglement of a quantum
	channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity of
	any channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical

	via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated, classical
	dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum
	behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is
	opposed to anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute
	equivalent sources of bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms

	by a monotonic transition, on a scale defined by the coherence length
	of the interfering particles. As we move to larger systems, any attempt
	to understand many particles via the two-particle paradigm fails:
	In contrast to two-particle bunching and anti-bunching, the very
	same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and fermions, and coherent
	effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The simulation of many-boson
	interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a qualitatively superior
	computational complexity when compared to fermions. The hierarchy
	between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite entanglement
	generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions. Finally,
	the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable
	and many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures.
	While the same physical principles govern small and large systems,
	the deployment of the intrinsic complexity of collective many-body
	interference makes more particles behave differently.},

	that scale linearly with the number of orbitals and a number of gates
	that scales polynomially with the number of orbitals. The scaling
	of the number of gates for such methods, while polynomial, presents
	some serious experimental challenges. However, because the number
	of electrons is a good quantum number for the electronic structure
	problem it is unncessary to store the full Fock space of the orbitals.
	Representation of the wave function in a basis of slater determinants
	for fixed electron number suffices. However, to date techniques for
	the quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian represented in this basis
	- the CI-matrix - have been lacking. We show how to apply techniques
	developed for the simulation of sparse Hamiltonians to the CI-matrix.
	We prove a number of results exploiting the structure of the CI-matrix,

	that it is possible to use the minimal number of qubits to represent

  abstract = {Electronic devices all around us contain classical control circuits.
	Such circuits consist of a network of controllers which can read
	and write signals to wires of the circuit with the goal to minimize
	the cost function of the circuit's output signal. Here, we propose
	the use of shared entanglement between controllers as a resource
	to improve the performance of otherwise purely classical control
	circuits. We study a well-known example from the classical control
	literature and demonstrate that allowing two controllers to share
	entanglement improves their ability to control. More precisely, we
	exhibit a family of circuits in which the the cost function using
	entanglement stays constant, but the minimal cost function without
	entanglement grows arbitrarily large. This demonstrates that entanglement
	can be a powerful resource in a classical control circuit.},

	Here I derive formulas that relate the error penalty caused by quantum

	In particular, we determine all three and four-partite Bell inequalities
	constructed from one and two-body expectation values that obey translational
	symmetry, and show that they reveal nonlocality in multipartite states.
	Also, by providing a particular example of a five-partite Bell inequality,
	we show that nonlocality can be detected from two-body correlators
	involving only nearest neighbours. Finally, we demonstrate that any
	translationally invariant Bell inequality can be maximally violated
	by a translationally invariant state and the same set of observables
	at all sites. We provide a numerical algorithm allowing one to seek
	for maximal violation of a translationally invariant Bell inequality.},

	calculations are presented for tunneling in cubic and quartic potentials.
	For a long post-selected tunneling time, the imaginary part of the

	the particle tunnels. It would be very interesting to observe this

  abstract = {In quantum theory, observables with a continuous spectrum are known
	to be fundamentally different from those with a discrete and finite
	spectrum. While some fundamental tests and applications of quantum
	mechanics originally formulated for discrete variables have been
	translated to continuous ones, this is not the case in general. For
	instance, despite their importance, no experimental demonstration
	of nonlocality exists in the continuous variables regime. Attempts
	to bridge this gap and put continuous variables on a closer footing
	to discrete ones used dichotomization. However, this approach considers
	only discrete properties of the continuum, and its infinitesimal
	properties are not fully exploited. Here we show that it is possible
	to manipulate, detect and classify continuous variable states using
	observables with a continuous spectrum revealing properties and symmetries
	which are analogous to finite discrete systems. Our approach leads
	to an operational way to define and adapt, to arbitrary continuous
	quantum systems, quantum protocols and algorithms typical to discrete
	systems.},

  abstract = {Entanglement is a resource in quantum information theory when state
	manipulation is restricted to Local Operations assisted by Classical
	Communication (LOCC). It is, therefore, of paramount importance to
	decide which LOCC transformations are possible and, particularly,
	which states are maximally useful under this restriction. While the
	bipartite maximally entangled state is well known (it is the only
	state that cannot be obtained from any other and, at the same time,
	it can be transformed to any other by LOCC), no such state exists
	in the multipartite case. In order to scope with this fact, we introduce
	here the notion of the Maximally Entangled Set (MES) of n-partite
	states. This is the set of states which are maximally useful under
	LOCC manipulation, i. e. any state outside of this set can be obtained
	via LOCC from one of the states within the set and no state in the
	set can be obtained from any other state via LOCC. We determine the
	MES for three and four qubit states and provide a simple characterization
	for them. In both cases, infinitely many states are required. However,
	while the MES is of zero-measure for 3-qubit states, almost all 4-qubit
	states are in the MES. This is because, in contrast to the 3-qubit
	case, deterministic LOCC transformations are almost never possible
	among fully entangled four-partite states. We determine the zero-measure
	subset of the MES of LOCC convertible states. This is the only relevant
	class of states for entanglement manipulation.},

  note = {arXiv:1403.4228v1},
  abstract = {Recently the question of whether the D-Wave processors exhibit large-scale
	quantum behavior or can be described by a classical model has attracted
	significant interest. In this work we address this question by studying
	a 503 qubit D-Wave Two device as a "black box", i.e., by studying
	its input-output behavior. We examine three candidate classical models
	and one quantum model, and compare their predictions to experiments
	we have performed on the device using groups of up to 40 qubits.
	The candidate classical models are simulated annealing, spin dynamics,
	a recently proposed hybrid O(2) rotor-Monte Carlo model, and three
	modified versions thereof. The quantum model is an adiabatic Markovian
	master equation derived in the weak coupling limit of an open quantum
	system. Our experiments realize an evolution from a transverse field
	to an Ising Hamiltonian, with a final-time degenerate ground state
	that splits into two types of states we call "isolated" and "clustered".
	We study the population ratio of the isolated and clustered states
	as a function of the overall energy scale of the Ising term, and
	the distance between the final state and the Gibbs state, and find
	that these are sensitive probes that distinguish the classical models
	from one another and from both the experimental data and the master
	equation. The classical models are all found to disagree with the
	data, while the master equation agrees with the experiment without
	fine-tuning, and predicts mixed state entanglement at intermediate
	evolution times. This suggests that an open system quantum dynamical
	description of the D-Wave device is well-justified even in the presence
	of relevant thermal excitations and fast single-qubit decoherence.},

  year = {2011},
  month = {jun},
  abstract = {Quantum discord, a kind of quantum correlation, is defined as the
	difference between quantum mutual information and classical correlation
	in a bipartite system. It has been discussed so far for small systems
	with only a few independent parameters. We extend here to a much
	broader class of states when the second party is of arbitrary dimension
	d, so long as the first, measured, party is a qubit. We present two
	formulae to calculate quantum discord, the first relating to the
	original entropic definition and the second to a recently proposed
	geometric distance measure which leads to an analytical formulation.
	The tracing over the qubit in the entropic calculation is reduced
	to a very simple prescription. And, when the d-dimensional system
	is a so-called X state, the density matrix having non-zero elements
	only along the diagonal and anti-diagonal so as to appear visually
	like the letter X, the entropic calculation can be carried out analytically.
	Such states of the full bipartite qubit-qudit system may be named
	"extended X states", whose density matrix is built of four block
	matrices, each visually appearing as an X. The optimization involved
	in the entropic calculation is generally over two parameters, reducing
	to one for many cases, and avoided altogether for an overwhelmingly
	large set of density matrices as our numerical investigations demonstrate.
	Our results also apply to states of a N-qubit system, where "extended
	X states" consist of (2^(N+2) - 1) states, larger in number than
	the (2^(N+1) - 1) of X states of N qubits. While these are still
	smaller than the total number (2^(2N) - 1) of states of N qubits,
	the number of parameters involved is nevertheless large. In the case
	of N = 2, they encompass the entire 15-dimensional parameter space,
	that is, the extended X states for N = 2 represent the full qubit-qubit
	system.},

	to master the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology:
	fast and accurate systems control together with perfect shielding
	from the environment, including the measurements apparatus, to achieve
	long quantum coherence. Excellent examples for hybrid quantum systems
	are heterogeneous spin systems where electron spins are used for
	readout and control while nuclear spins are used as long-lived quantum
	bits. Here we show that joint initialization, projective readout
	and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer conflicting
	requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We
	demonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register
	(99 %) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins
	by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect
	in diamond. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our
	hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register allows to prepare entangled
	states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 %. An
	important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum error
	correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based
	error avoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip
	error correction algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the
	above algorithms achieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum
	operation, thus paving the way to large scale integrations. Our techniques
	can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on diamond

  abstract = {Does "epistemic non-signalling" ensure the peaceful coexistence of
	special relativity and quantum nonlocality? The possibility of an
	affirmative answer is of great importance to deterministic approaches
	to quantum mechanics given recent developments towards generalizations
	of Bell's theorem. By generalizations of Bell's theorem we here mean
	efforts that seek to demonstrate the impossibility of any deterministic
	theories to obey the predictions of Bell's theorem, including even
	nonlocal hidden-variables theories such as de Broglie-Bohm theory.
	The present work offers arguments showing why such efforts towards
	generalization may fall short of their stated goal. In particular,
	we reject the use of the non-signalling theorem as an argument against
	the logical possibility of deterministic quantum theories. We proceed
	by presenting an entirely informal treatment of key physical and
	metaphysical assumptions, and of their interrelationship, in attempts
	seeking to generalize Bell's theorem on the basis of an ontic, foundational
	interpretation of the non-signalling theorem. We here argue that
	the non-signalling theorem must instead be viewed as an epistemic,
	phenomenological, or operational theorem i.e. one that refers exclusively
	to what epistemic agents can, or rather cannot, do. That is, we emphasize
	that the non-signalling theorem is a theorem about the operational
	inability of epistemic agents, e.g. human observers, to signal information.
	A major reason in favor of our conclusion is that any definition
	of signalling or of non-signalling invariably requires a reference
	to epistemic agents, and what these agents can actually measure and
	report; otherwise, the non-signalling theorem would equal a general
	"no-influence" theorem.},

	paper, we prove that the estimates produced by randomized benchmarking
	(both standard and interleaved) for arbitrary Markovian noise sources
	are remarkably precise by showing that the variance of the underlying
	distribution is small. In particular, we prove that the variance
	for arbitrary $d$-level systems decreases exponentially in the sequence
	length to a small constant (that is zero for unital noise), and moreover,
	the variance is bounded by the error rate for short sequences. In
	the special case of a single qubit, we prove that the variance scales
	with the square of the product of the sequence length and the error
	rate for the regimes currently being investigated experimentally.
	We also show that randomized benchmarking can be used to reliably
	characterize the time-dependent average gate fidelity and diamond
	distance for Markovian noise (which characterize the average and
	worst-case error rates, respectively), provided the noise is sufficiently
	close to gate-independent at each time step, and we provide a quantitative
	condition for stability with respect to these perturbations. Moreover,
	we identify a necessary property for time-dependent noise that is
	violated by some sources of non-Markovian noise, which provides a
	test for non-Markovianity. Finally, we identify a necessary choice
	of parameters for randomized benchmarking experiments, namely, that
	the number of random sequences sampled should scale with the length
	of the sequence in order for all data points to have comparable uncertainties.},

  abstract = {The theory of electrical networks has many applications in algorithm
	design and analysis. It is an important problem to compute the basic
	quantities about electrical networks, such as electrical flows and
	effective resistances, as fast as possible. Classically, to compute
	these quantities, one need to solve a Laplacian system, and the best
	known algorithm takes nearly-linear time in the number of edges in
	the graph. In this paper, we present two quantum algorithms for approximating
	the effective resistance between any two vertices in a weighted graph.
	Both of them have time complexity $\poly{\log{n},d,c,1/\phi,1/\epsilon}$,
	where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph, $d$ is the maximum
	degree of the graph, $c$ is the ratio of the maximum edge weight
	to the minimum edge weight, $\phi$ is the expansion of the graph,
	and $\epsilon$ is the relative error. The dependence of our algorithms
	on the graph's size is exponentially better than that of known classical
	algorithms. Furthermore, as by-products, our algorithms also yield
	good approximations of electrical flows and electrical potentials
	(as quantum states) respectively, which might be of independent interest.
	Finally, we give evidence that the polynomial dependence of our algorithms
	on the inverse expansion is necessary. Our algorithms are based on
	the technique of using quantum tools to study the algebraic properties
	of various matrices in spectral graph theory. While the first algorithm
	relies on implementing the projection onto the kernel of a weighted
	incidence matrix, and the second one relies on inverting the Laplacian
	matrix. It is hopeful that more quantum algorithms could be devised
	in similar way.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics is nonlocal. But it is not more nonlocal than no-signaling
	since of the principle of causality. Conversely, the no-signaling
	correlations are more nonlocal than those allowed in quantum mechanics.
	This is demonstrated in an enlightening multipartite game, "guess
	your neighbor's input" (GYNI). Yet, it is challenging to fully solve
	this game, only the simplest tripartite case is solved analytically
	under a specified assumption. Here, we propose the conceptually new
	Bell equality which is satisfied by all no-signaling correlations
	including quantum and classical correlations as special cases. By
	applying those Bell equalities, we provide a general framework in
	solving the GYNI scheme and confirm its validity for the number of
	players up to 19. Particularly, the tripartite case is fully solved
	analytically which provides a computable measure of supra-quantum
	correlation. The proposed Bell equality provides a precise principle
	for all no-signaling correlations.},

	quantum information processing based on stationary electron-spin
	qubits, by using the giant optical circular birefringence induced
	by quantum-dot spins in double-sided optical microcavities as a result
	of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We design the quantum circuits
	for implementing universal and deterministic quantum gates for electron-spin
	systems, including two-qubit controlled-not, $\sqrt{\textrm{SWAP}}$,
	SWAP, three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates. They have good scalability
	and are attractive as they are compact and all are based on solid-state
	quantum systems. Moreover, our devices do not require additional
	electron-spin qubits and they are feasible with current experimental
	technology. Both high fidelity and high efficiency can be achieved
	when the side leakage to the cavity decay is low.},

  abstract = {A strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of a quantum
	channel states that the probability of correctly decoding a classical
	message converges exponentially fast to zero in the limit of many
	channel uses if the rate of communication exceeds the classical capacity
	of the channel. Along with a corresponding achievability statement
	for rates below the capacity, such a strong converse theorem enhances
	our understanding of the capacity as a very sharp dividing line between
	possible and impossible rates of communication. Here, we show that
	such a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of
	all entanglement-breaking channels. This result follows by bounding
	the success probability in terms of a "sandwiched" Renyi relative
	entropy, by showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking
	channels, and by relating this quantity to the Holevo capacity. Prior
	results regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant
	channels emerge as a special case of our results.},

	of a quantum channel [Guha et al., PRX 4:011016, 2014] to be much
	larger than its private capacity. Both reflect different ways of
	capturing the notion of reliable communication via a quantum system
	while leaking almost no information to an eavesdropper; the difference
	is that the latter imposes an intrinsically quantum security criterion
	whereas the former requires only a weaker, classical condition. The
	channels for which this separation is most straightforward to establish
	are the complementary channels of classical-quantum (cq-)channels,
	and hence a subclass of Hadamard channels. We also prove that certain
	symmetric channels (related to photon number splitting) have positive
	weak locking capacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared
	secret, whereas their private capacity is zero. These findings are
	powerful illustrations of the difference between two apparently natural
	notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to quantum key
	distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible information,
	contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum nature
	of the eavesdropper's information. Assuming an additivity conjecture
	for constrained minimum output Renyi entropies, the techniques of
	the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula for the weak locking
	capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a general
	upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels. Furthermore, still
	assuming this additivity conjecture, this upper bound is given an
	operational interpretation for general channels as the maximum weak

  note = {arXiv:1402.0351v1},
  abstract = {Many of the heated arguments about the meaning of "Bell's theorem"
	arise because this phrase can refer to two different theorems that
	John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964
	theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the dual
	assumptions of locality and determinism. His 1976 theorem is the
	incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the unitary property of
	local causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions,
	that his 1964 theorem began with that single, and indivisible, assumption
	of local causality (even if not by that name). While there are other
	forms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation
	between Jarrett-completeness, "weak locality", and EPR-completeness
	--- I maintain that Bell's two versions are the essential ones. Although
	the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions
	are not, and the different versions of the theorem suggest quite
	different conclusions, which are embraced by different communities.
	For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled out by Bell's
	1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle
	of common cause and explicitly by Einstein's relativity Principle,
	and it is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists pay no
	heed to Reichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep Einstein's relativity
	Principle, which, bolstered by an implicit "Principle of causal efficacy",
	implies their notion of locality. Thus for operationalists, Bell's
	theorem is the 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that
	must be forgone. I discuss why the two `camps' are drawn to these
	different conclusions, and what can be done to increase mutual understanding.},

	In this paper, we develop SWAP, a theoretical concept which, in combination

	state and quantum measurements from the observed measurement statistics.
	As an illustration of the power of our new approach, we provide a

	violation larger than 2.57 gives a fidelity of more than 70% between
	the black box quantum state and the singlet. Also, we prove that
	maximal violation of CGLMP must be non maximally entangled, and robustly
	self test quantum states in the CGLMP scenario for which Jordan's
	Lemma cannot be used. Furthermore, this SWAP method can also be extended

  abstract = {The realization of a scalable quantum information processor has emerged
	over the past decade as one of the central challenges at the interface
	of fundamental science and engineering. Much progress has been made
	towards this goal. Indeed, quantum operations have been demonstrated
	on several trapped ion qubits, and other solid-state systems are
	approaching similar levels of control. Extending these techniques
	to achieve fault-tolerant operations in larger systems with more
	qubits remains an extremely challenging goal, in part, due to the

	which include disorder and relevant decoherence mechanisms, and includes
	a hierarchy of control at successive length scales. Our approach
	is based upon recent experimental advances involving Nitrogen-Vacancy
	color centers in diamond and will provide fundamental insights into

	Here, we argue that this is not always the case. We demonstrate that

	finite magnetization. This weak violation of the Arrhenius law occurs
	above the percolation temperature, but below the transition temperature,

  note = {arXiv:1310.0529v1},
  abstract = {Analog models of quantum information processing, such as adiabatic
	quantum computation and analog quantum simulation, require the ability
	to subject a system to precisely specified Hamiltonians. Unfortunately,
	the hardware used to implement these Hamiltonians will be imperfect
	and limited in its precision. Even small perturbations and imprecisions
	can have profound effects on the nature of the ground state. Here
	we consider an imperfect implementation of adiabatic quantum optimization
	and show that, for a widely applicable random control noise model,
	quantum stabilizer encodings are able to reduce the effective noise
	magnitude and thus improve the likelihood of a successful computation
	or simulation. This reduction builds upon two design principles:
	summation of equivalent logical operators to increase the energy
	scale of the encoded optimization problem, and the inclusion of a
	penalty term comprising the sum of the code stabilizer elements.
	We illustrate our findings with an Ising ladder and show that classical
	repetition coding drastically increases the probability that the
	ground state of a perturbed model is decodable to that of the unperturbed
	model, while using only realistic two-body interaction. Finally,
	we note that the repetition encoding is a special case of quantum
	stabilizer encodings, and show that this in principle allows us to

	will be necessary for large scale computations. Error handling routines
	developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily
	to the AQC model since these routines typically require high-quality
	quantum gates, a resource not generally allowed in AQC. There are
	two main techniques known to suppress errors during an AQC implementation:
	energy gap protection and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that
	both these methods are intimately related and can be analyzed within
	the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression
	techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of
	error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself
	is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form
	of error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing
	error correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems.

	the development of computational methods based on modern digital
	computers. However, these methods can hardly fulfill the exponentially-growing
	resource requirements when applied to large quantum systems. As pointed
	out by Feynman, this restriction is intrinsic to all computational
	models based on classical physics. Recently, the rapid advancement
	of trapped-ion technologies has opened new possibilities for quantum
	control and quantum simulations. Here, we present an efficient toolkit
	that exploits both the internal and motional degrees of freedom of
	trapped ions for solving problems in quantum chemistry, including
	molecular electronic structure, molecular dynamics, and vibronic
	coupling. We focus on applications that go beyond the capacity of
	classical computers, but may be realizable on state-of-the-art trapped-ion

	chemistry that shifts from the current transistor to a near-future

  abstract = {A fundamental task in photonics is to characterise an unknown optical
	process, defined by properties such as birefringence, spectral response,
	thickness and flatness. Amongst many ways to achieve this, single-photon
	probes can be used in a method called quantum process tomography
	(QPT). Furthermore, QPT is an essential method in determining how
	a process acts on quantum mechanical states. For example for quantum
	technology, QPT is used to characterise multi-qubit processors and
	quantum communication channels; across quantum physics QPT of some
	form is often the first experimental investigation of a new physical
	process, as shown in the recent research into coherent transport
	in biological mechanisms. However, the precision of QPT is limited
	by the fact that measurements with single-particle probes are subject
	to unavoidable shot noise---this holds for both single photon and
	laser probes. In situations where measurement resources are limited,
	for example, where the process is rapidly changing or the time bandwidth
	is constrained, it becomes essential to overcome this precision limit.
	Here we devise and demonstrate a scheme for tomography which exploits
	non-classical input states and quantum interferences; unlike previous
	QPT methods our scheme capitalises upon the possibility to use simultaneously
	multiple photons per mode. The efficiency---quantified by precision
	per photon used---scales with larger photon number input states.
	Our demonstration uses four-photon states and our results show a
	substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations compared to traditional
	QPT methods---in the ideal case one four-photon probe state yields
	the same amount of statistical information as twelve single probe
	photons.},

  abstract = {The transmission of quantum states through spin chains is an important
	task in the implementation of quantum information technologies. Many
	protocols were developed to achieve the high fidelities needed for
	the state transfer. However, highly demanding and challenging requirements
	have to be met that are not feasible with present technologies. The
	main difficulty is the finite precision of the engineering of quantum
	devices. Very recently, conditions have been identified which enable
	reliable and robust transmission in the presence of exchange coupling
	disorder. These conditions only require control of the boundary couplings
	of the channel rather than the very demanding engineering of the
	complete set of couplings. In this work we present a systematic study
	of the principal disordered spin chains that have been analyzed in
	the literature as possible quantum information transmission channels.
	Our study focuses on the properties of the chain configuration which
	ensure, on average, a successful state transmission, but not on the
	encoding of the state to be transmitted or on means to improve the
	readout of the arriving signal. We demonstrate that quite different
	XX spin chain configurations subjected to the same disorder model
	show qualitatively the same performance. More importantly, that performance,
	as measured by the fidelity, shows the same scaling behavior with
	chain length and disorder strength for all systems studied. Our results
	are helpful in identifying the optimal spin chain for a given quantum

	it is worthwhile to engineer all couplings in the chain as compared
	to adjusting only the boundary couplings.},

  abstract = {Shortened abstract: In this thesis, I study two restricted models of quantum computing related to free identical particles. Free fermions correspond to a set of two-qubit gates known as matchgates. Matchgates are classically simulable when acting on nearest neighbors on a path, but universal for quantum computing when acting on distant qubits or when SWAP gates are available. I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show that SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to quantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any nonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this fact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the power of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically simulable on a cycle. I also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction. Free bosons give rise to a model known as BosonSampling. BosonSampling consists of (i) preparing a Fock state of n photons, (ii) interfering these photons in an m-mode linear interferometer, and (iii) measuring the output in the Fock basis. Sampling approximately from the resulting distribution should be classically hard, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Here I show that exact BosonSampling remains hard even if the linear-optical circuit has constant depth. I also report several experiments where three-photon interference was observed in integrated interferometers of various sizes, providing some of the first implementations of BosonSampling in this regime. The experiments also focus on the bosonic bunching behavior and on validation of BosonSampling devices. This thesis contains descriptions of the numerical analyses done on the experimental data, omitted from the corresponding publications.},

Analogous results are also obtained for a more general case of several orthogonal measurements performed in generic bases.},

  abstract = {The patterns of fringes produced by an interferometer have always been important testbeds for our best contemporary theories of physics. Historically, interference has been used to contrast quantum mechanics to classical physics, but recently experiments have been performed that test quantum theory against even more exotic alternatives. A physically motivated family of theories are those where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of arbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and quaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of simultaneity (that observers may disagree about the order of events at different locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer. We show that this forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of standard complex quantum theory. In this sense, special relativity itself can be used to explain why physics should be described by the rules of quantum theory in this setup. Moreover, our result has consequences for actual interference experiments that are currently performed in the lab: they have to be designed carefully to avoid rendering beyond-quantum effects invisible by relativity of simultaneity.},

  abstract = {Quantum entanglement is a fundamental aspect in quantum mechanics, plays a vital role in field of quantum information science. Entangled states in high-dimensional space show many advantages compared with the states entangled in two-dimensional space: enabling communication with higher channel capacity, affording the more secure quantum key distribution, etc. Quantum memory for the high-dimensional entanglement is essential for realizing long-distance high capacity quantum communication, it can reduce the sensitivity to memory coherence time, lead to significant improvements in storage capacity. However, to date, there is a vacancy in storing high-dimensional entanglement although many people are attracted in preparing such a genuine high-dimensional entangled state. Here, we experimentally realize the storage of a high-dimensional photonic entangled state encoded in orbital angular momentum space, establishing the high-dimensional entanglement between two 1-meter separated atomic ensembles. We reconstruct the density matrix of a three-dimensional entanglement, obtain the storage fidelity of 83.9%+/-2.9%. Most importantly, we experimentally perform the storage of an 8-dimensional entanglement, the retrieved state shows the 7-dimensional entanglement by using entanglement witness. This experiment makes a significant step for achieving the high-dimensional quantum network.},

We propose a control protocol to transfer atoms from the ground state of a well to the ground state of the neighbouring well. Furthermore, we show that the detrimental effects of the inter-particle repulsion can be eliminated by means of a compensating control pulse, yielding, quite surprisingly, an enhancement of the transfer speed because of the particle interaction -- in contrast to the self-trapping scenario.

The class is defined by imagining that quantum computers can perform measurements that do not collapse the wavefunction. This (non-physical) model of computation can efficiently solve problems such as Graph Isomorphism and Approximate Shortest Vector which are believed to be intractable for quantum computers. Furthermore, it can search an unstructured N-element list in $\tilde O$(N^{1/3}) time, but no faster than {\Omega}(N^{1/4}), and hence cannot solve NP-hard problems in a black box manner. In short, this model of computation is more powerful than standard quantum computation, but only slightly so. Our work is inspired by previous work of Aaronson on the power of sampling the histories of hidden variables. However Aaronson's work contains an error in its proof of the lower bound for search, and hence it is unclear whether or not his model allows for search in logarithmic time. Our work can be viewed as a conceptual simplification of Aaronson's approach, with a provable polynomial lower bound for search.},

First, we provide several general bounds on this amount involving quantum discord. Then, we investigate the question of whether the task of entanglement distribution is more efficient if some amount of entanglement - or some amount of correlations in general - between the parties is available prior to the transmission stage of the protocol. We show that in the presence of a nontrivial noise the answer to this question strongly depends on the type of it and on the way entanglement is quantified. In particular, subadditive entanglement measures do not display this effect if entanglement is established via single-qubit Pauli channels. On the other hand, based on the superadditivity conjecture of the distillable entanglement, we provide evidence that this phenomenon occurs for this measure. We also present a counter-intuitive phenomenon of the advantage of arbitrarily little entangled states over maximally entangled ones, which may occur for quantum channels relevant in experiments.},

At the classical level, they induce causal paradoxes disturbing enough to motivate conjectures that explicitly prevent their existence. At the quantum level, resolving such paradoxes induce radical benefits - from cloning unknown quantum states to solving problems intractable to quantum computers. Instinctively, one expects these benefits to vanish if causality is respected. Here we show that in harnessing entanglement, we can efficiently solve NP-complete problems and clone arbitrary quantum states - even when all time-travelling systems are completely isolated from the past. Thus, the many defining benefits of closed timelike curves can still be harnessed, even when causality is preserved. Our results unveil the subtle interplay between entanglement and general relativity, and significantly improve the potential of probing the radical effects that may exist at the interface between relativity and quantum theory.},

  abstract = {Generic interacting many-body systems are usually expected to thermalise following out of equilibrium dynamics: Local expectation values should be captured in terms of thermal ensembles. This behaviour necessarily relies on transport in the system, in the sense that information spreads outside of any finite region. A notable class of models that contradicts this intuition is given by systems exhibiting many-body localisation. Their eigenstates are strongly lacking entanglement, concomitant with an absence of thermalisation. The description of these models often relies on local constants of motion, certain operators that remain local even for infinite times. In this work, we show that counter-intuitively, the existence of such operators, together with a suitable non-degenerate Hamiltonian spectrum, implies that there exist other operators for which the system has to have information transport. While upper bounds on information propagation have long been known, lower bounds have only been obtained for very specific models. We also use the developed perturbation analysis to show that approximately local constants of motion can indeed be used to construct efficient spectral tensor networks, as recently suggested. Our results constitute an important step towards proving transport in generic systems.},

A classification of SPT phases can hence be obtained by studying the topological obstructions to continuously deforming one set of matrix product operators into another. This leads to the classification of bosonic SPT states in terms of group cohomology, as originally derived by Chen et al. in [1106.4772]. Our formalism accommodates perturbations away from fixed point models, and hence opens up the possibility of studying phase transitions between different SPT phases. We furthermore show how the global symmetries of SPT PEPS can be promoted into a set of local gauge constraints by introducing bosonic degrees of freedom on the links of the PEPS lattice, thereby providing a natural and general mapping between PEPS in SPT phases and topologically ordered phases.},

  abstract = {We show that families of Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuits corresponding to nontrivial Bell tests exhibit nonlocality. However, we also prove that this nonlocality can only be demonstrated using post-selection or nonlinear processing of the measurement outcomes. Therefore if the output of a computation is encoded in the parity of the measurement outcomes, then families of IQP circuits whose full output distributions are hard to sample still only provide a computational advantage relative to locally causal theories under post-selection. Consequently, post-selection is a crucial technique for obtaining a computational advantage for IQP circuits (with respect to decision problems) and for demonstrating nonlocality within IQP circuits, suggesting a strong link between these phenomena.},

  abstract = {One of the most important questions in quantum information theory is the so-called separability problem. It involves characterizing the set of separable (or, equivalently entangled) states among mixed states of a multipartite quantum system. In this thesis we study the generalization of this problem to types of quantum correlations that are defined in a manner analogous to entanglement. We start with the subset of set of pure states of a given quantum system and call states belonging to the convex hull of this subset "non-correlated" states. Consequently, the states laying outside the convex hull are referred to as "correlated". In this work we focus on cases when there exist a symmetry group that preserves the class of "non-correlated" pure states. The presence of symmetries allows to obtain a unified treatment of many types of seemingly unrelated types of correlations. We apply our general results to particular types of correlations: (i) entanglement of distinguishable particles, (ii) particle entanglement of bosons, (iii) "entanglement" of fermions, (iv) non-convex-Gaussian correlations in fermionic systems, (v) genuine multiparty entanglement, and finally (vi) refined notions of bipartite entanglement based on the concept of the Schmidt number. We investigate the natural problems and questions concerning the correlations defined above: (I) We provide explicit polynomial characterization of various types of correlations for pure states. (II) We examine cases in which it is possible to give a complete analytical characterization of correlated mixed states. (III) We derive a variety of polynomial criteria for detection of correlations in mixed states.(IV) We use the above criteria and the technique of measure concentration to study typical properties of correlations on sets of isospectral density matrices.},

  abstract = {In a quantum computer, creating superpositions of quantum bits (qubits) in different states can lead to a speed-up over classical computers [1], but quantum mechanics also allows for the superposition of quantum circuits [2]. In fact, it has recently been theoretically predicted that superimposing quantum circuits, each with a different gate order, could provide quantum computers with an even further computational advantage [3-5]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this enhancement by applying two quantum gates in a superposition of both possible orders to determine whether the two gates commute or anti-commute. We are able to make this determination with only a single use (or query) of each gate, while all quantum circuits with a fixed order of gates would require at least two uses of one of the gates [3]. Remarkably, when the problem is scaled to N gates, creating a superposition of quantum circuits is likely to provide an exponential advantage over classical algorithms, and a linear advantage over quantum algorithms with fixed gate order [4]. The new resource that we exploit in our experiment can be interpreted as a "superposition of causal orders". We demonstrate such a superposition could allow some quantum algorithms to be implemented with an efficiency that is unlikely to be achieved on a quantum computer with a fixed gate order.},

  abstract = {The third law of thermodynamics has a controversial past and a number of formulations due to Planck, Einstein, and Nernst. It's most accepted version, the unattainability principle, states that "any thermodynamic process cannot reach the temperature of absolute zero by a finite number of steps and within a finite time". Although formulated in 1912, there has been no general proof of the principle, and the only evidence we have for it is that particular cooling methods become less efficient as a the temperature lowers. Here we provide the first derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to arbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. Further, we quantify the time or number of steps it takes to cool a system to any particular temperature. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of the bath being positive for large temperatures, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect cooling in finite time is in principle possible. Our results also clarify the connection between two versions of the third law (the Unattainability Principle, and the Heat Theorem), and place ultimate bounds on the speed at which information can be erased.},

  abstract = {The relative entropy is a principal measure of distinguishability in quantum information theory, with its most important property being that it is non-increasing under noisy quantum operations. Here, we establish a remainder term for this inequality that quantifies how well one can recover from a loss of information by employing a rotated Petz recovery map. The main approach for proving this refinement is to combine the methods of [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] with the notion of a relative typical subspace from [Bjelakovic and Siegmund-Schultze, arXiv:quant-ph/0307170]. It remains an open question if the same bound holds for the Petz recovery map (and not merely for a rotated Petz recovery map). A well known result states that the monotonicity of relative entropy under quantum operations is equivalent to any of the following inequalities: strong subadditivity of entropy, concavity of conditional entropy, joint convexity of relative entropy, and monotonicity of relative entropy under partial trace. We show that this equivalence holds true for refinements of all these inequalities in terms of the Petz recovery map. So either all of these refinements are true or all are false.},

  abstract = {Among several tasks in Machine Learning, a specially important one is that of inferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the observed behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process is a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP and its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and control theory, and positive systems theory. We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and the system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the quantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum instrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any-- yields the process at hand by iterative application. We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a description of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on state vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state vectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden Markov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any stochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy any positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then consists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of the same process exists. We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show that the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding possible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our results have potential applications in quantum machine learning, device-independent characterization and reverse-engineering of stochastic processes and quantum processors, and dynamical processes with quantum memory.},

However, magic state preparation inevitably involves nonideal operations that introduce noise. The most common method to eliminate the noise is magic state distillation (MSD) by stabilizer operations. Here we propose a hybrid MSD protocol by connecting a four-qubit H-type MSD with a five-qubit T-type MSD, in order to overcome some disadvantages of the previous MSD protocols. The hybrid MSD protocol further integrates distillable ranges of different existing MSD protocols and extends the T-type distillable range to the stabilizer octahedron edges. And it provides considerable improvement in qubit cost for almost all of the distillable range. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate the four-qubit H-type MSD protocol using nuclear magnetic resonance technology, together with the previous five-qubit MSD experiment, to show the feasibility of the hybrid MSD protocol.},

The scattering takes place under 1D confinement for which we consider two different scenarios: a 1D wave-guide and a tight-binding lattice. We consider models with a delta interaction between two fermionic or two bosonic particles. A qubit is encoded in two distinct spin (or other internal) states of each particle. Our scheme, by providing a gate between qubits which are initially too far to interact directly, provides an alternative to photonic mediators for the scaling of quantum computers. Fundamentally, an interesting feature is that "identical particles" (e.g., two atoms of the same species) and the 1D confinement, are both necessary for the action of the gate. Effects of the departure from 1D confinement, the degree of control required on the initial motional states of particles, and how to achieve the same, are discussed, as well as the feasibility of atomic implementations.},

  abstract = {We prove a general lower bound to the spectral gap of the Davies generator for Pauli stabilizer Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians, defined on the Hilbert space of $N$-qubits, serve as one of the most frequently considered candidates for a self-correcting quantum memory. A spectral gap bound on the Davies generator establishes an upper limit on the life time of such a quantum memory and can be used to estimate the time until the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium when brought into contact with a thermal heat bath. The bound can be shown to behave as $\lambda \geq {\cal O}(N^{-1}\exp(-2\beta \, \overline{\epsilon}))$, where $\overline{\epsilon}$ is a generalization of the well known energy barrier for logical operators. Particularly in the low temperature regime we expect this bound to provide the correct asymptotic scaling of the gap with the system size up to a factor of $N^{-1}$.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon, important in many theoretical studies and applications. Recently this effect has been analyzed and observed in a number of physical systems close to the quantum mechanical regime. In this work we propose the mutual information as a useful order parameter which can capture the emergence of synchronization in very different contexts, ranging from semi-classical to intrinsically quantum mechanical systems. Specifically we first study the synchronization of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators in both classical and quantum regimes and later we consider the synchronization of two qubits inside two coupled optical cavities. In all these contexts, we find that mutual information can be used as an appropriate figure of merit for determining the synchronization phases, independently of the specific details of the system.},

We show that strong correlations arise between the spin and vibrational degrees of freedom within each ion and find that when two ions synchronize their spin degrees of freedom in turn become correlated.

  abstract = {Adiabatic quantum computing~(AQC) is based on the adiabatic principle, where a quantum system remains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the driving Hamiltonian. The final state of the Hamiltonian encodes solution to the problem of interest. While AQC has distinct advantages, recent researches have shown that quantumness such as quantum coherence in adiabatic processes may be lost entirely due to the system-bath interaction when the evolution time is long, and consequently the expected quantum speedup dose not show up. Here we propose a fast-signal assisted adiabatic quantum algorithm. We find that by applying a sequence of fast random or regular signals during the evolution process, the runtime can be reduced greatly, yet advantages of the adiabatic algorithm remain intact. Significantly, we present a \emph{randomized} Trotter formula and show that the driving Hamiltonian and the sequence of fast signals can be implemented simultaneously. We apply the algorithm for solving the $3$-bit exact cover problem~(EC$3$) and put forward an approach for implementing the problem with trapped ions.},

  abstract = {In this review, we discuss a relation between quantum communication complexity and a long-standing debate in quantum foundation concerning the interpretation of the quantum state. Is the quantum state a physical element of reality as originally interpreted by Schrodinger? Or is it an abstract mathematical object containing statistical information about the outcome of measurements as interpreted by Born? Although these questions sound philosophical and pointless, they can be made precise in the framework of what we call classical theories of quantum processes, which are a reword of quantum phenomena in the language of classical probability theory. In 2012, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) proved, under an assumption of preparation independence, a theorem supporting the original interpretation of Schrodinger in the classical framework. Recently, we showed that these questions are related to a practical problem in quantum communication complexity, namely, quantifying the minimal amount of classical communication required in the classical simulation of a two-party quantum communication process. In particular, we argued that the statement of the PBR theorem can be proved if the classical communication cost of simulating the communication of n qubits grows more than exponentially in 'n'. Our argument is based on an assumption that we call probability equipartition property. This property is somehow weaker than the preparation independence property used in the PBR theorem, as the former can be justified by the latter and the asymptotic equipartition property of independent stochastic sources. The equipartition property is a general and natural hypothesis that can be assumed even if the preparation independence hypothesis is dropped. In this review, we further develop our argument into the form of a theorem.},

Furthermore, we show that when the engine includes a quantum work storage device we can approximately perform completely general unitaries on the remainder of the engine. This framework can be used in quantum thermodynamics to carry out arbitrary transformations of a system, with accuracy and extracted work as close to optimal as desired, whilst obeying the first and second laws of thermodynamics.

The symmetry of SICs is intimately connected with the geometry of the quantum state space and also has profound implications for foundational studies. Here we study those SICs that are most symmetric according to a natural criterion and show that all of them are covariant with respect to the Heisenberg-Weyl groups, which are characterized by the discrete analog of the canonical commutation relation. Moreover, their symmetry groups are subgroups of the Clifford groups. In particular, we prove that the SIC in dimension~2, the Hesse SIC in dimension~3, and the set of Hoggar lines in dimension~8 are the only three SICs up to unitary equivalence whose symmetry groups act transitively on pairs of SIC projectors. Our work is of intrinsic interest to studying the geometry of quantum state space and foundational issues entangled with the geometry.},

We propose a much weaker, physically motivated notion of independence, which merely prohibits the possibility of super-luminal causal influences in the preparation process. This is a minimum requirement for maintaining a reasonable notion of subsystem. Under the weaker assumption, it is shown that the argument of PBR becomes invalid. We propose an experiment involving randomly sampled preparations that realises an approximation of the result, which becomes exact in the limit as the sample space of preparations becomes infinite, thereby proving a stronger theorem asserting the reality of the quantum state. The theorem holds even if there are non-local correlations in the global ontic state. Conceptually, it shows that the degree to which the quantum state may be statistical is limited by the degree to which (sub)systems may be composed.},

In this work we introduce the concept of approximate degradable channels, which satisfy this condition up to some finite $\varepsilon\geq0$. That is, there exists a degrading map which upon composition with the channel is $\varepsilon$-close in the diamond norm to the complementary channel. We show that for any fixed channel the smallest such $\varepsilon$ can be efficiently determined via a semidefinite program. Moreover, these approximate degradable channels also approximately inherit all other properties of degradable channels.

  abstract = {In this paper, we use a database of around 400,000 metaorders issued by investors and electronically traded on European markets in 2010 in order to study market impact at different scales. At the intraday scale we confirm a square root temporary impact in the daily participation, and we shed light on a duration factor in $1/T^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \simeq 0.25$. Including this factor in the fits reinforces the square root shape of impact. We observe a power-law for the transient impact with an exponent between $0.5$ (for long metaorders) and $0.8$ (for shorter ones). Moreover we show that the market does not anticipate the size of the meta-orders. The intraday decay seems to exhibit two regimes (though hard to identify precisely): a "slow" regime right after the execution of the meta-order followed by a faster one. At the daily time scale, we show price moves after a metaorder can be split between realizations of expected returns that have triggered the investing decision and an idiosynchratic impact that slowly decays to zero. Moreover we propose a class of toy models based on Hawkes processes (the Hawkes Impact Models, HIM) to illustrate our reasoning. We show how the Impulsive-HIM model, despite its simplicity, embeds appealing features like transience and decay of impact. The latter is parametrized by a parameter $C$ having a macroscopic interpretation: the ratio of contrarian reaction (i.e. impact decay) and of the "herding" reaction (i.e. impact amplification).},

  abstract = {Quantum computing becomes viable when a quantum state can be preserved from environmentally-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation by guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical failure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition (QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits and a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of environmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the many exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer.},

  abstract = {We consider a realistic setting of quantum tasks that generate shared bipartite quantum states. Suppose \alice and \bob are located at different places and need to produce a target shared quantum state $\rho$. In order to save quantum communication, they can choose to share a proper smaller quantum state $\sigma$ first, and then turn $\sigma$ to $\rho$ by performing only local quantum operations and classical communications (LOCC). We hope $\sigma$ is the optimal such that the quantum communication needed is as little as possible, which is called the generation cost of $\rho$. In this paper, for an arbitrary bipartite $\rho$, we characterize its generation cost completely by proving that it is exactly equivalent to the logarithm of the Schmidt number of $\rho$. Similar quantum schemes where classical communication is not allowed have actually been considered. By comparing the two settings, we are able to look into the role that classical communication plays in these fundamental tasks, where we exhibit some instances in which classical communication is not helpful completely.},

  abstract = {Characterizing genuine multipartite quantum correlations in quantum physical systems has historically been a challenging problem in quantum information theory. More recently however, the total correlation or multipartite information measure has been helpful in accomplishing this goal, especially with the multipartite symmetric quantum (MSQ) discord [Piani et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 090502, 2008] and the conditional entanglement of multipartite information (CEMI) [Yang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140501, 2008]. Here we apply a recent and significant improvement of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] in order to develop these quantities further. In particular, we prove that the MSQ discord is nearly equal to zero if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is approximately locally recoverable after performing measurements on each of its systems. Furthermore, we prove that the CEMI is a faithful entanglement measure, i.e., it vanishes if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated is a fully separable state. Along the way we provide an operational interpretation of the MSQ discord in terms of the partial state distribution protocol, which in turn, as a special case, gives an interpretation for the original discord quantity. Finally, we prove an inequality that could potentially improve upon the Fawzi-Renner inequality in the multipartite context, but it remains an open question to determine whether this is so.},

We introduce the notion of distillation under limited resources, and specifically focus on the energy constraint. The corresponding protocol, which we call the canonical distillation of entanglement, naturally leads to the set of canonically distillable states. We show that for non-interacting Hamiltonians, almost no states are canonically distillable, while the situation can be drastically different for interacting ones. Several paradigmatic Hamiltonians are considered for bipartite as well as multipartite canonical distillability. The results have potential applications for practical quantum communication devices.},

Compared with more than $10^8$ experiments required by full process tomography, we conducted 1656 experiments to satisfy a statistical confidence level of 99%. The average fidelity of this Clifford gate in experiment is 55.1%, and rises to 87.5% if the infidelity due to decoherence is removed. The entire protocol of certifying Clifford gates is efficient and scalable, and can easily be extended to any general quantum information processor with minor modifications.},

A violation of this inequality normally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key distribution, so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. Here, we show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled systems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to compromise the system without leaving a trace. With tailored pulses of classical light we reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6% detector efficiency which is an extreme violation. This is the first demonstration of a violation-faking source that both gives tunable violation and high detector efficiency. The implications are severe: the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality cannot be used to show device-independent security for standard postselecting energy-time entanglement setups. We conclude with suggestions of improved tests and experimental setups that can re-establish device-independent security.},

As opposed to the exponential scaling with the number of subsystems of standard quantum process tomography, the method relies only on measurements of linearly many local observables and either (a) the ability to prepare eigenstates of locally informationally complete operators or (b) access to an ancilla of the same size as the to-be-characterized system and the ability to prepare a maximally entangled state on the combined system. As such, the method requires at most linearly many states to be prepared and linearly many observables to be measured. The quality of the reconstruction can be quantified with the same experimental resources that are required to obtain the reconstruction in the first place.

This requires the algorithm on input x to output a nonnegative random variable whose expectation equals f(x), using as few queries to the input x as possible. We exactly characterize both the randomized and the quantum query complexity by two polynomial degrees, the nonnegative literal degree and the sum-of-squares degree, respectively. We observe that the quantum complexity can be unboundedly smaller than the classical complexity for some functions, but can be at most polynomially smaller for functions with range {0,1}. These query complexities relate to (and are motivated by) the extension complexity of polytopes. The linear extension complexity of a polytope is characterized by the randomized communication complexity of computing its slack matrix in expectation, and the semidefinite (psd) extension complexity is characterized by the analogous quantum model. Since query complexity can be used to upper bound communication complexity of related functions, we can derive some upper bounds on psd extension complexity by constructing efficient quantum query algorithms. As an example we give an exponentially-close entrywise approximation of the slack matrix of the perfect matching polytope with psd-rank only 2^{n^{1/2+epsilon}}. Finally, we show there is a precise sense in which randomized/quantum query complexity in expectation corresponds to the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies, respectively.},

A consequence is that the noise tolerance for secure randomness expansion only needs to be small enough that it rules out deterministic behavior of the device. This greatly reduces the requirement on implementation precision. For example, for the CHSH game, the noise can be 10.3%, compared with 1.5% in the previous bound. We also show that similar results hold with nonlocality replaced by the broader concept of contextuality, and the spatial separation requirement replaced by the broader compatibility requirement. This is the first full quantum security proof for contextuality-based randomness expansion. For both nonlocality and contextuality, we have identified the minimum device requirement. Our results imply in particular the equivalence of quantum security with classical security for the protocols considered.

The construction is inspired by the classical Ising model on a Sierpinski carpet fractal, which acts as a classical self-correcting memory. Our models are naturally defined on fractal subsets of a 4D hypercubic lattice which can be embedded into 3D space with finite distortion. The X and Z sectors of the code are dual to one another, and we show that there exists a finite temperature phase transition associated with each of these sectors, providing evidence that the system may robustly store quantum information at finite temperature.},

  abstract = {To use quantum systems for technological applications we first need to preserve their coherence for macroscopic timescales, even at finite temperature. Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct errors that affect a quantum memory. An attractive scenario is the construction of passive storage of quantum information with minimal active support. Indeed, passive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology, physically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard disk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open problem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been devised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes. Here we review the state-of-the-art developments in this field in an informative and pedagogical way. We give the main principles of self-correcting quantum memories and we analyze several milestone examples from the literature of two-, three- and higher-dimensional quantum memories.},

  abstract = {We achieve essentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexities. We do so using a property-testing problem called Forrelation, where one needs to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function. This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs ~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^{1/4} lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N^{1-1/2t})-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear. We conjecture that a natural generalization of Forrelation achieves the optimal t versus ~N^{1-1/2t} separation for all t. As a bonus, we show that this generalization is BQP-complete. This yields what's arguably the simplest BQP-complete problem yet known, and gives a second sense in which Forrelation "captures the maximum power of quantum computation."},

  abstract = {It is well known that string theory generates the idea of higher dimensional spacetime instead of the (3+1) dimensions, in which we seem to live. It indicates that the extra space dimensions may remain curled up into very small space. In this paper, we study quantum mechanical scattering in presence of extra compact space dimension in the hope of devising a method to get a clue to the presence of extra space dimension. We consider a simplified model of scattering, in which a beam of free particles is scattered due to a one dimensional Dirac-delta potential in presence of an extra compact space dimension. We find that the incident, reflected and transmitted probability current densities of the particles contain the information of the extra dimension. Thus, by measuring experimentally the reflected and transmitted probability current densities of the particles, we may confirm the presence of extra dimension. We also show that the idea of compactification of the extra dimensions gives rise to the quantization of the energy values of the free particles. So, by measuring the quantized energy values of the scattered free particles, we may again confirm the presence of extra dimensions. We also discuss briefly, how the extra compact space dimensions can be detected if the scattering process is performed in (9+1) dimensions, in which six space dimensions are compact.},

Furthermore, the probe particle symmetry is found to play a significant role in limiting $M$ and thereby, in limiting extractable information in a measurement. In particular, for $N$ indistinguishable spin-half probe particles, it is shown that $M$ is tightly bounded to $O(N^2)$. The corresponding operator that saturates this bound represents a non interferometric measurement. While inherently Heisenberg limited, this measurement is precise up to $\delta \sim 1/N^2$. These results can be used to benchmark any precision measurement thereby establishing a particular link between information theory and metrology.},

In this paper, we derive a one-body reduced density matrix dynamics for electrons in energetic contact with a bath. We obtain a remarkable equation of motion which shows that in order to reach equilibrium properly, rates of electron transitions depend on the density matrix. Even though the bath drives the electrons towards a Boltzmann distribution, hole blocking factors in our equation of motion cause the electronic populations to relax to a Fermi-Dirac distribution. These factors are an old concept, but we show how they can be derived with a combination of time-dependent perturbation theory, and the extended normal ordering of Mukherjee and Kutzelnigg. The resulting non-equilibrium kinetic equations generalize the usual Redfield theory to many-electron systems, while ensuring that the orbital occupations remain between zero and one. In numerical applications of our equations, we show that relaxation rates of molecules are not constant because of the blocking effect. Other applications to model atomic chains are also presented which highlight the importance of treating both dephasing and relaxation. Finally we show how the bath localizes the electron density matrix.},

Several hypothesized features of this cortical algorithm are reviewed, including sparse distributed representation, Bayesian inference, hierarchical organization composed of alternating template matching and pooling layers, temporal slowness and predictive coding. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a family of learning algorithms and corresponding theories of cortical function that embodies these principles. HTM has previously been applied mainly to perceptual tasks typical of posterior cortex. In order to evaluate HTM as a candidate model of cortical function, it is necessary also to investigate its compatibility with the requirements of frontal cortical function. To this end, a variety of models of frontal cortical function are reviewed and integrated, to arrive at the hypothesis that frontal functions including attention, working memory and action selection depend largely upon the same basic algorithms as do posterior functions, with the notable additions of a mechanism for the active maintenance of representations and of multiple cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops that allow communication between regions of frontal cortex to be gated in an adaptive manner. Computational models of this system are reviewed. Finally, there is a discussion of how HTM can contribute to the understanding of frontal cortical function, and of what the requirements of frontal cortical function mean for the future development of HTM.},

When given a correlation (a collection of conditional probability distributions) from an experiment or from a theory, it is desirable to determine the extent to which the participating parties would need to collaborate nonlocally for its (re)production. Here, we propose to achieve this via the minimal group size (MGS) of the resource, i.e., the smallest number of parties that need to share a given type of nonlocal resource for the above-mentioned purpose. In addition, we provide a general recipe --- based on the lifting of Bell-like inequalities --- to construct MGS witnesses for non-signaling resources starting from any given ones. En route to illustrating the applicability of this recipe, we also show that when restricted to the space of full-correlation functions, non-signaling resources are as powerful as unconstrained signaling resources. Explicit examples of correlations where their MGS can be determined using this recipe and other numerical techniques are provided.},

In this Letter we first revisit a previously proposed scheme that realizes bit commitment using only classical communication. We prove that the protocol is secure against quantum adversaries for a duration limited by the light-speed communication time between the locations of the agents. We then propose a novel multi-round scheme based on finite-field arithmetic that extends the commitment time beyond this limit, and we prove its security against classical attacks. Finally, we present an implementation of these protocols using dedicated hardware and we show how it could be used to realize commitments of duration ranging up to 212 milliseconds by agents occupying antipodal locations on the Earth.},

Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of specific systematic errors.

It is thus natural to ask to which degree the causal assumptions -- e.g. locality or measurement independence -- have to be relaxed in order to allow for a classical description of such experiments. Here, we develop a conceptual and computational framework for treating this problem. We employ the language of Bayesian networks to systematically construct alternative causal structures and bound the degree of relaxation using quantitative measures that originate from the mathematical theory of causality. The main technical insight is that the resulting problems can often be expressed as computationally tractable linear programs. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by applying it to a variety of scenarios, ranging from relaxations of the measurement independence, locality and bilocality assumptions, to a novel causal interpretation of CHSH inequality violations.},

  abstract = {We show that universal holonomic quantum computation (HQC) can be achieved fault-tolerantly by adiabatically deforming the gapped stabilizer Hamiltonian of the surface code, where quantum information is encoded in the degenerate ground space of the system Hamiltonian. We explicitly propose procedures to perform each logical operation, including logical state initialization, logical state measurement, logical CNOT, state injection and distillation,etc. In particular, adiabatic braiding of different types of holes on the surface leads to a topologically protected, non-Abelian geometric logical CNOT. Throughout the computation, quantum information is protected from both small perturbations and low weight thermal excitations by a constant energy gap, and is independent of the system size. Also the Hamiltonian terms have weight at most four during the whole process. The effect of thermal error propagation is considered during the adiabatic code deformation. With the help of active error correction, this scheme is fault-tolerant, in the sense that the computation time can be arbitrarily long for large enough lattice size. It is shown that the frequency of error correction and the physical resources needed can be greatly reduced by the constant energy gap.},

  abstract = {The generation of random numbers via quantum processes is an efficient and reliable method to obtain true indeterministic random numbers that are of vital importance to cryptographic communication and large scale computer modelling. However, in realistic scenarios, the raw output of a quantum random number generator is inevitably tainted with classical technical noise. The integrity of the device could be compromised if this noise is tampered with, or even controlled by some malicious party. To safeguard against this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach that produces side-information independent randomness that is quantified by min-entropy conditioned on this classical noise. We present a method for maximising the conditional min-entropy of the number sequence generated from a given quantum to classical noise ratio (QCNR). The detected photo-current in our experiment is shown to have a real-time random number generation rate of 14 Mbps/MHz. Integrating this figure across the spectral response of the detection system shows the potential to deliver more than 70 Gbps of random numbers in our experimental setup.},

  abstract = {The free energy difference limits the amount of work that can be extracted on average using heat baths of fixed temperature from a system out of thermal equilibrium. This bound can be saturated by protocols putting the system and a bath into weak thermal contact (WTC), i.e., bringing the system into a Gibbs state at the bath's temperature. In this sense, WTC is universal for work extraction -- a notion that can be made precise in a variety of operational frameworks. In this work, we introduce the study of work-extraction protocols under restrictions encountered in realistic devices at the nano-scale. We consider limitations on the maximum energies in the system and on the local structure of many-body Hamiltonians. Remarkably, we find that WTC then loses its universality. We do so by proving a general bound for the extractable work in such restricted scenarios. This is used to prove a gap between the work the can be extracted with WTC and with more general operations. Our work highlights the relevance of operational frameworks such as those of thermal operations and Gibbs preserving maps, as they can improve the performance of thermal machines. Furthermore, it provides a unifying framework of incorporating natural restrictions in quantum thermodynamics.},

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers above the energy of the state itself. Tunneling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we present the first experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum tunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer. We develop a theoretical model based on a NIBA Quantum Master Equation to describe the multiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise characteristics of such quantum devices. We start by considering a computational primitive, the simplest non-convex optimization problem consisting of just one global and one local minimum. The quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. In our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of qubit clusters with strong intra-cluster coupling. We show that the collective effect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the "critical" phase during the evolution where quantum tunneling "decides" the right path to solution. In a later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the solution state. The predictions of the model accurately describe the experimental data from the D-Wave Two quantum annealer at NASA Ames. In our computational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of success in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with thermal hopping. Specifically, we provide an analysis of an optimization problem with sixteen qubits, demonstrating eight qubit tunneling that increases success probabilities. Furthermore, we report results for larger problems with up to 200 qubits that contain the primitive as subproblems.},

With an additional overhead of ancilla qubits, the new code can also be made spatially local. Applying our construction to certain concatenated stabilizer codes yields families of subsystem codes with constant-weight generators and with minimum distance $d = n^{1-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon = O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$. For spatially local codes in $D$ dimensions we nearly saturate a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal and achieve $d = n^{1-\varepsilon-1/D}$.

  abstract = {The surface code is one of the most promising candidates for combating errors in large scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. A fault-tolerant decoder is a vital part of the error correction process---it is the algorithm which computes the operations needed to correct or compensate for the errors according to the measured syndrome, even when the measurement itself is error prone. Previously decoders based on minimum-weight perfect matching have been studied. However, these are computationally expensive and not immediately generalizable from qubit to qudit codes. In this work, we develop a fast fault-tolerant decoder for the surface code, capable of efficient operation for qubits and qudits of any dimension, generalizing the decoder first introduced by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200501 (2013)]. We study its performance when both the physical qudits and the syndromes measurements are subject to generalized uncorrelated bit-flip noise (and the higher dimensional equivalent). We show that, with appropriate enhancements to the decoder and a high enough qudit dimension, a threshold at an error rate of more than 8% can be achieved.},

We prove that the set of quantum many-body states that satisfy an area law for all Renyi entropies contains a subspace of exponential dimension. Establishing a novel link between quantum many-body theory and the theory of communication complexity, we then show that there are states satisfying area laws for all Renyi entropies but cannot be approximated by states with a classical description of small Kolmogorov complexity, including polynomial projected entangled pair states (PEPS) or states of multi-scale entanglement renormalisation (MERA). Not even a quantum computer with post-selection can efficiently prepare all quantum states fulfilling an area law, and we show that not all area law states can be eigenstates of local Hamiltonians. We also prove translationally invariant and isotropic instances of these results.},

By employing adiabatic dressing of the ground electronic state, we can protect the gate from decoherence due to random phase errors that typically arise because of atomic thermal motion. In addition, the adiabatic protocol allows for a Doppler-free configuration that involves counterpropagating lasers in a $\sigma_+/\sigma_-$ orthogonal polarization geometry that further reduces motional errors due to Doppler shifts. The residual motional error is dominated by dipole-dipole forces acting on doubly-excited Rydberg atoms when the blockade is imperfect. For reasonable parameters, with qubits encoded into the clock states of $^{133}$Cs, we predict that our protocol could produce a CZ gate in $<10$ $\mu$s with error probability on the order of $10^{-3}$.},

We then discuss the axiom of purification, which expresses a strong version of the Conservation of Information and captures the core of a vast number of protocols in quantum information. Purification is a highly non-classical feature and leads directly to the emergence of entanglement at the purely conceptual level, without any reference to the superposition principle.

  abstract = {A simple quantum interaction is analyzed, where the paths of two superposed particles asymmetrically cross, while a detector set to detect an interaction between them remains silent. Despite this negative result, the particles' states leave no doubt that a peculiar interaction has occurred: One particle's momentum changes while the other's remains unaffected, in apparent violation of momentum conservation. Revisiting the foundations of the quantum measurement process offers the resolution. Prior to the macroscopic recording of no interaction, a brief Critical Interval prevails, during which the particles and the detector's pointer form a subtle entanglement which immediately dissolves. It is this self-cancellation, henceforth "Quantum Oblivion (QO)," that lies at the basis of some well-known intriguing quantum effects. Such is Interaction-Free Measurement (IFM) [1] and its more paradoxical variants, like Hardy's Paradox [2] and the Quantum Liar Paradox [3]. Even the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect [4] and weak measurement [5] turn out to belong to this group. We next study interventions within the Critical Interval that produce some other peculiar effects. Finally we discuss some of the conceptual issues involved. Under the time-resolution of the Critical Interval, some nonlocal phenomena turn out to be local. Momentum is conserved due to the quantum uncertainties inflicted by the particle-pointer interaction, which sets the experiment's final boundary condition.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of constructing multi-source extractors in the quantum setting, which extract almost uniform random bits against quantum side information collected from several initially independent classical random sources. This is a natural generalization of seeded randomness extraction against quantum side information and classical independent source extraction. With new challenges such as potential entanglement in the side information, it is not a prior clear under what conditions do quantum multi-source extractors exist; the only previous work is [KK12], where the classical inner-product two-source extractors of [CG88] and [DEOR04] are shown to be quantum secure in the restricted Independent Adversary (IA) Model and entangled Bounded Storage (BS) Model. In this paper we propose a new model called General Entangled (GE) Adversary Model, which allows arbitrary entanglement in the side information and subsumes both the IA model and the BS model. We proceed to show how to construct GE-secure quantum multi-source extractors. To that end, we propose another model called One-sided Adversary (OA) Model, which is weaker than all the above models. Somewhat surprisingly, we establish equivalence between strong OA-security and strong GE-security. As a result, all classical multi-source extractors can either directly work, or be modified to work in the GE model at the cost of one extra random source. Thus, our constructions essentially match the best known constructions of classical multi-source extractors. We also apply our techniques to two important problems in cryptography and distributed computing --- privacy amplification and network extractor. We show that as long as the sources have certain amounts of conditional min-entropy in our GE model (even with entangled quantum side information), we can design very efficient privacy amplification protocols and network extractors.},

The possibility of contrasting the noisy effects introduced by the channel iterations via the action of intermediate ({\it filtering}) transformations is analyzed. We provide some examples in which our functionals can be exactly calculated. The differences between unitary and non-unitary filtering operations are analyzed showing that, at least for systems of dimension $d$ larger than or equal to 3, the non-unitary choice is preferable (the gap between the performances of the two cases being divergent in some cases). For $d=2$ (qubit case) on the contrary no evidences of the presence of such gap is revealed: we conjecture that for this special case unitary filtering transformations are optimal. The scenario in which more general LOCC operations are allowed as filtering transformations is also considered.

  abstract = {Quantum simulation of many-body systems are one of the most interesting tasks of quantum technology. Among them is the preparation of a many-body system in its ground state when the vanishing energy gap makes the cooling mechanisms ineffective. Adiabatic theorem, as an alternative to cooling, can be exploited for driving the many-body system to its ground state. In this paper, we study two most common disorders in quantum dot arrays, namely exchange coupling fluctuations and hyperfine interaction, in adiabatically preparation of ground state in such systems. We show that the adiabatic ground state preparation is highly robust against those disorder effects making it good analog simulator. Moreover, we also study the adiabatic classical information transfer, using singlet-triplet states, across a spin chain. In contrast to ground state preparation the transfer mechanism is highly affected by disorder and in particular, the hyperfine interaction is very destructive for the performance. This suggests that for communication tasks across such arrays adiabatic evolution is not as effective and quantum quenches could be preferable.},

  abstract = {We propose an environment recycling scheme to speed up a class of tensor network algorithms that produce an approximation to the ground state of a local Hamiltonian by simulating an evolution in imaginary time. Specifically, we consider the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm applied to infinite systems in 1D and 2D, where the ground state is encoded, respectively, in a matrix product state (MPS) and in a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS). An important ingredient of the TEBD algorithm (and a main computational bottle-neck, especially with PEPS in 2D) is the computation of the so-called environment, which is used to determine how to optimally truncate the bond indices of the tensor network so that their dimension is kept constant. In current algorithms, the environment is computed at each step of the imaginary time evolution, to account for the changes that the time evolution introduces in the many-body state represented by the tensor network. Our key insight is that close to convergence, most of the changes in the environment are due to a change in the choice of gauge in the bond indices of the tensor network, and not in the many-body state. Indeed, a consistent choice of gauge in the bond indices confirms that the environment is essentially the same over many time steps and can thus be re-used, leading to very substantial computational savings. We demonstrate the resulting approach in 1D and 2D by computing the ground state of the quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic field.},

  abstract = {In the context of multiplayer games, the parallel repetition problem can be phrased as follows: given a game $G$ with optimal winning probability $1-\alpha$ and its repeated version $G^n$ (in which $n$ games are played together, in parallel), can the players use strategies that are substantially better than ones in which each game is played independently? This question is relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this work the case of multiplayer non-signalling games is considered, i.e., the only restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players we prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signalling players win more than a fraction $1-\alpha+\beta$ of the $n$ games is exponentially small in $n\beta^2$, for every $0\leq \beta \leq \alpha$. For games with incomplete support we derive a similar statement, for a slightly modified form of repetition. The result is proved using a new technique, based on a recent de Finetti theorem, which allows us to avoid central technical difficulties that arise in standard proofs of parallel repetition theorems.},

At the same time, all three parties have access to a separate source of correlated bits, and their goal is to convert these two resources into multiple copies of some given tripartite distribution $P_{XYZ}$. We obtain a single-letter characterization of the trade-off between public and private bits that are needed to achieve this task. The rate of private bits is shown to generalize Wyner's classic notion of common information held between a pair of random variables. The problem we consider is also closely related to the task of secrecy formation in which $P_{XYZ}$ is generated using public communication and local randomness but with Charlie functioning as an adversary instead of a collaborator. We describe in detail the differences between the collaborative and adversarial scenarios.},

This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals.},

  abstract = {Quantum codes excel at correcting local noise but fail to correct leakage faults that excite qubits to states outside the computational space. Aliferis and Terhal have shown that an accuracy threshold exists for leakage faults using gadgets called leakage reduction units (LRUs). However, these gadgets reduce the accuracy threshold and can increase overhead and experimental complexity, and these costs have not been thoroughly understood. Our work explores a variety of techniques for leakage-resilient, fault-tolerant error correction in the context of topological codes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we develop a leakage model that differs in critical details from earlier models. Second, we use Monte-Carlo simulations to survey several syndrome extraction circuits. Third, given the capability to perform three-outcome measurements, we present a dramatically improved syndrome processing algorithm. Our simulation results show that simple circuits with one extra CNOT per qubit and no additional ancillas reduce the accuracy threshold by less than a factor of 4 when leakage and depolarizing noise rates are comparable. This becomes a factor of 2 when the decoder uses 3-outcome measurements. Finally, when the physical error rate is less than 2 x 10^-4, placing LRUs after every gate may achieve the lowest logical error rates of all of the circuits we considered. We expect the closely related planar and rotated codes to exhibit the same accuracy thresholds and that the ideas may generalize naturally to other topological codes.},

This reduction is of the same order as the (previously introduced) locally optimal feedback protocol. The advantage of the open loop protocol is that it is far less difficult experimentally. Because the control commutes with the measured observable at all times, our rapid measurement protocol could be used for characterizing a quantum system, by state or process tomography, or to implement measurement-based quantum error correction.},

Prior work has bounded errors due to Trotterization in terms of the norm of the error operator and analyzed scaling with respect to the number of spin-orbitals. However, we find that these error bounds can be loose by up to sixteen orders of magnitude for some molecules. Furthermore, numerical results for small systems fail to reveal any clear correlation between ground state error and number of spin-orbitals. We instead argue that chemical properties, such as the maximum nuclear charge in a molecule and the filling fraction of orbitals, can be decisive for determining the cost of a quantum simulation. Our analysis motivates several strategies to use classical processing to further reduce the required Trotter step size and to estimate the necessary number of steps, without requiring additional quantum resources. Finally, we demonstrate improved methods for state preparation techniques which are asymptotically superior to proposals in the simulation literature.},

  abstract = {The operational formalism to quantum mechanics seeks to base the theory on a firm foundation of physically well-motivated axioms [1]. It has succeeded in deriving the Feynman rules [2] for general quantum systems. Additional elaborations have applied the same logic to the question of identical particles, confirming the so-called Symmetrization Postulate [3]: that the only two options available are fermions and bosons [4,5]. However, this seems to run counter to results in two-dimensional systems, which allow for anyons, particles with statistics which interpolate between Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein (see [6] for a review). In this talk we will show that the results in two dimensions can be made compatible with the operational results. That is, we will show that anyonic behavior is a result of the topology of the space in two dimensions [7], and does not depend on the particles being identical; but that nevertheless, if the particles are identical, the resulting system is still anyonic.},

  abstract = {Recent randomness expansion protocols have been proposed which are able to generate an unbounded amount of randomness from a finite amount of truly random initial seed. One such protocol, given by Miller and Shi, uses a pair of non-signaling untrusted quantum mechanical devices. These play XOR games with inputs given by the user in order to generate an output. Here we present an analysis of the required seed size, giving explicit upper bounds for the number of initial random bits needed to jump-start the protocol. The bits output from such a protocol are $\varepsilon$-close to uniform even against quantum adversaries. Our analysis yields that for a statistical distance of $\varepsilon=10^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$ from uniformity, the number of required bits is smaller than 225,000 and 715,000, respectively; in general it grows as $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$.},

When a new magic state is first encoded, its initial fidelity will be too poor for use in the computation. This necessitates a resource-intensive distillation process that occupies the majority of the computer's hardware; creating magic states with a high initial fidelity minimises this cost and is therefore crucial for practical quantum computing. Here we present the surprising and encouraging result that raw magic states can have a fidelity significantly better than that of the two-qubit gate operations used to construct them. Our protocol exploits post-selection without significantly slowing the rate of generation and tolerates finite error rates in initialisations, measurements and single-qubit gates.

With the exception of the negativity, such quantities tend to be rather uncomputable. In this paper, we instead promote the idea of conversion witnesses, which are functions on pairs of state whose value determines whether one state can be converted into the other. We construct a computable conversion witness that is better than the negativity at detecting when two entangled states are not interconvertible. This shows that the study of conversion witness is in fact useful, and may have applications in resource theories beyond that of entanglement.},

Furthermore, we study the geometry of these particular state spaces, the inherent symmetries, the cyclicity of the phase operations, and the regions of (genuine multi-partite) entanglement and the several classes of separability.

Important physical properties often do not depend on the whole wave function but rather only on the marginals. Not every collection of reduced density matrices can arise as the marginals of a quantum state. Instead, there are profound compatibility conditions -- such as Pauli's exclusion principle or the monogamy of quantum entanglement -- which fundamentally influence the physics of many-body quantum systems and the structure of quantum information. The aim of this thesis is a systematic and rigorous study of the general relation between multipartite quantum states, i.e., states of quantum systems that are composed of several subsystems, and their marginals. In the first part, we focus on the one-body marginals of multipartite quantum states; in the second part, we study general quantum marginals from the perspective of entropy.},

  abstract = {To build a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it is necessary to implement a quantum error correcting code. Such codes rely on the ability to extract information about the quantum error syndrome while not destroying the quantum information encoded in the system. Stabilizer codes are attractive solutions to this problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple and easily computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. In these codes, syndrome extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizer measurements, which are bit and phase parity checks up to local operations. Previously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions, and superconducting qubits. However these implementations lack the ability to perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction which continues to be a challenge for all physical quantum computing systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate a key step towards this problem by using a two-by-two lattice of superconducting qubits to perform syndrome extraction and arbitrary error detection via simultaneous quantum non-demolition stabilizer measurements. This lattice represents a primitive tile for the surface code, which is a promising stabilizer code for scalable quantum computing. Furthermore, we successfully show the preservation of an entangled state in the presence of an arbitrary applied error through high-fidelity syndrome measurement. Our results bolster the promise of employing lattices of superconducting qubits for larger-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

  abstract = {Quantum communication will improve the security of cryptographic systems and decision-making algorithms, support secure client-server computation, and improve the sensitivity of scientific instruments. As these applications consume quantum entanglement, a method for replenishing networked entanglement is essential. Direct transmission of quantum signals over long distances is prevented by fibre attenuation and the no-cloning theorem. This has motivated the development of quantum repeaters, which are designed to purify entanglement and extend its range. Quantum repeaters have been demonstrated over short distances, but an error-corrected repeater network with sufficient bandwidth over global distances will require new technology. In particular, no proposed hardware appears suitable for deployment along undersea cables, leaving the prospect of isolated metropolitan networks. Here we show that error-corrected quantum memories installed in cargo containers and carried by ship could provide a flexible and scalable connection between local networks, enabling low-latency, high-fidelity quantum communication across global distances. With recent demonstrations of quantum technology with sufficient fidelity to enable topological error correction, implementation of the necessary quantum memories is within reach, and effective bandwidth will increase with improvements in fabrication. Thus, our architecture provides a new approach to quantum networking that avoids many of the technological requirements of undersea quantum repeaters, providing an alternate path to a worldwide Quantum Internet.},

The trivial classical algorithm for APSP and most all pairs path problems runs in $O(n^3)$ time, while the trivial algorithm in the quantum setting runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.5})$ time, using Grover search. A major open problem in classical algorithms is to obtain a truly subcubic time algorithm for APSP, i.e. an algorithm running in $O(n^{3-\varepsilon})$ time for constant $\varepsilon>0$. To approach this problem, many truly subcubic time classical algorithms have been devised for APSP and its variants for structured inputs. Some examples of such problems are APSP in geometrically weighted graphs, graphs with small integer edge weights or a small number of weights incident to each vertex, and the all pairs earliest arrivals problem. In this paper we revisit these problems in the quantum setting and obtain the first nontrivial (i.e. $O(n^{2.5-\varepsilon})$ time) quantum algorithms for the problems.},

  abstract = {We consider error suppression schemes in which quantum information is encoded into the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian comprising a sum of commuting terms. Since such Hamiltonians are gapped they are considered natural candidates for protection of quantum information and topological or adiabatic quantum computation. However, we prove that they cannot be used to this end in the 2-local case. By making the favorable assumption that the gap is infinite we show that single-site perturbations can generate a degeneracy splitting in the ground subspace of this type of Hamiltonians which is of the same order as the magnitude of the perturbation, and is independent of the number of interacting sites and their Hilbert space dimensions, just as in the absence of the protecting Hamiltonian. This splitting results in decoherence of the ground subspace, and we demonstrate that for natural noise models the coherence time is proportional to the inverse of the degeneracy splitting. Our proof involves a new version of the no-hiding theorem which shows that quantum information cannot be approximately hidden in the correlations between two quantum systems, and should be of independent interest. The main reason that 2-local commuting Hamiltonians cannot be used for quantum error suppression is that their ground subspaces have only short-range (two-body) entanglement.},

  abstract = {We present an algebraic framework to study the time-optimal synthesis of arbitrary unitaries in SU(2), when the control set is restricted to rotations around two non-parallel axes in the Bloch sphere. Our method bypasses commonly used control-theoretical techniques, and easily imposes necessary conditions on time-optimal sequences. In a straightforward fashion, we prove that time-optimal sequences are solely parametrized by three rotation angles and derive general bounds on those angles as a function of the relative rotation speed of each control and the angle between the axes. Results are substantially different whether both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations about the given axes are allowed, or only clockwise rotations. In the first case, we prove that any finite time-optimal sequence is composed at most of five control concatenations, while for the more restrictive case, we present scaling laws on the maximum length of any finite time-optimal sequence. The bounds we find for both cases are stricter than previously published ones and severely constrain the structure of time-optimal sequences, allowing for an efficient numerical search of the time-optimal solution. Our results can be used to find the time-optimal evolution of qubit systems under the action of the considered control set, and thus potentially increase the number of realizable unitaries before decoherence.},

  abstract = {In this thesis we examine a variety of techniques for reducing the resources required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. First, we show how to simplify universal encoded computation by using only transversal gates and standard error correction procedures, circumventing existing no-go theorems. We then show how to simplify ancilla preparation, reducing the cost of error correction by more than a factor of four. Using this optimized ancilla preparation, we develop improved techniques for proving rigorous lower bounds on the noise threshold. Additional overhead can be incurred because quantum algorithms must be translated into sequences of gates that are actually available in the quantum computer. In particular, arbitrary single-qubit rotations must be decomposed into a discrete set of fault-tolerant gates. We find that by using a special class of non-deterministic circuits, the cost of decomposition can be reduced by as much as a factor of four over state-of-the-art techniques, which typically use deterministic circuits. Finally, we examine global optimization of fault-tolerant quantum circuits under physical connectivity constraints. We adapt techniques from VLSI in order to minimize time and space usage for computations in the surface code, and we develop a software prototype to demonstrate the potential savings.},

Harmonic analysis allows any density operator to be decomposed in terms of mode operators which quantify the coherence present in a state in a natural way. We establish upper and lower bounds for the evolution of such modes under arbitrary thermal operations, and analyse primitive coherence manipulations. Well-studied thermo-majorization relations on block-diagonal quantum states correspond to constraints only on the zero-mode of a state, governing energy transfers.

  abstract = {In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs. The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of $G$ where Alice and Bob receive all the inputs at the same time and must produce all the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each instance of $G$. Recently, there has been a series of works showing parallel repetition with exponential decay for projection games [DSV13], games on the uniform distribution [CS14] and for free games, i.e. games on a product distribution [JPY13]. This article is meant to be a follow up of [CS14], where we improve and simplify several parts of our previous paper. Our main result is that for any free game $G$ with value $\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{\log(l)})}$ where $l$ is the size of the output set of the game. This result improves on both the results in [JPY13] and [CS14]. The framework we use can also be extended to free projection games. We show that for a free projection game $G$ with value $\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 - \varepsilon)^{\Omega(n)}$.},

  abstract = {Hard-decision renormalization group (HDRG) decoders are an important class of decoding algorithms for topological quantum error correction. Due to their versatility, they have been used to decode systems with fractal logical operators, color codes, qudit topological codes, and non-Abelian systems. In this work, we develop a method of performing HDRG decoding which combines strenghts of existing decoders and further improves upon them. In particular, we increase the minimal number of errors necessary for a logical error in a system of linear size $L$ from $\Theta(L^{2/3})$ to $\Omega(L^{1-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$. We apply our algorithm to decoding $D(\mathbb{Z}_d)$ quantum double models and a non-Abelian anyon model with Fibonacci-like fusion rules, and show that it indeed significantly outperforms previous HDRG decoders. Furthermore, we provide the first study of continuous error correction with imperfect syndrome measurements for the $D(\mathbb{Z}_d)$ quantum double models. The parallelized runtime of our algorithm is $\text{poly}(\log L)$ for the perfect measurement case. In the continuous case with imperfect syndrome measurements, the averaged runtime is $O(1)$ for Abelian systems, while continuous error correction for non-Abelian anyons stays an open problem.},

  abstract = {In non-relativistic quantum theories with short-range Hamiltonians, a velocity $v$ can be chosen such that the influence of any local perturbation is approximately confined to within a distance $r$ until a time $t \sim r/v$, thereby defining a linear light cone and giving rise to an emergent notion of locality. In systems with power-law ($1/r^{\alpha}$) interactions, when $\alpha$ exceeds the dimension $D$, an analogous bound confines influences to within a distance $r$ only until a time $t\sim(\alpha/v)\log r$, suggesting that the velocity, as calculated from the slope of the light cone, may grow exponentially in time. We rule out this possibility; light cones of power-law interacting systems are algebraic for $\alpha>2D$, becoming linear as $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. Our results impose strong new constraints on the growth of correlations and the production of entangled states in a variety of rapidly emerging, long-range interacting atomic, molecular, and optical systems.},

The initial resources required for the generation of a universal state in our protocol are 3-qubit cluster states that are within experimental reach and are a minimal resource for a Bell-measurement-based percolation proposal.

However, producing random numbers from a finite state machine, such as a classical computer, is impossible. One option is to use conventional quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on the intrinsic uncertainty of quantum measurement outcomes. The problem in this case is that private randomness relies on assumptions on the internal functioning of the measurement devices. "Device-independent" QRNGs not relying on devices inner workings assumptions can be built but are impractical. They require a detection efficiency that, so far, has only be achieved with trapped ions and with photons detected with transition-edge superconducting sensors. Here we introduce a novel protocol for quantum private randomness generation that makes no assumption on the functioning of the devices and works even with very low detection efficiency. We implement the protocol using weak coherent states and standard single-photon detectors. Our results pave the way towards a second generation of more secure practical QRNGs.},

  abstract = {The spectral statistics and entanglement within the eigenstates of generic spin chain Hamiltonians are analysed. A class of random matrix ensembles is defined which include the most general nearest-neighbour qubit chain Hamiltonians. For these ensembles, and their generalisations, it is seen that the long chain limiting spectral density is a Gaussian and that this convergence holds on the level of individual Hamiltonians. The rate of this convergence is numerically seen to be slow. Higher eigenvalue correlation statistics are also considered, the canonical nearest-neighbour level spacing statistics being numerically observed and linked with ensemble symmetries. A heuristic argument is given for a conjectured form of the full joint probability density function for the eigenvalues of a wide class of such ensembles. This is numerically verified in a particular case. For many translationally-invariant nearest-neighbour qubit Hamiltonians it is shown that there exists a complete orthonormal set of eigenstates for which the entanglement present in a generic member, between a fixed length block of qubits and the rest of the chain, approaches its maximal value as the chain length increases. Many such Hamiltonians are seen to exhibit a simple spectrum so that their eigenstates are unique up to phase. The entanglement within the eigenstates contrasts the spectral density for such Hamiltonians, which is that seen for a non-interacting chain of qubits. For such non-interacting chains, their always exists a basis of eigenstates for which there is no entanglement present.},

  abstract = {We study the amplification of security against quantum attacks provided by iteration of block ciphers. In the classical case, the Meet-in-the-middle attack is a generic attack against those constructions. This attack reduces the time required to break double iterations to only twice the time it takes to attack a single block cipher, given that the attacker has access to a large amount of memory. More abstractly, it shows that security by composition does not achieve exact multiplicative amplification. We present a quantized version of this attack based on an optimal quantum algorithm for the Element Distinctness problem. We then use the generalized adversary method to prove the optimality of the attack. An interesting corollary is that the time-space tradeoff for quantum attacks is very different from what classical attacks allow. This first result seems to indicate that composition resists better to quantum attacks than to classical ones because it prevents the quadratic speedup achieved by quantizing an exhaustive search. We investigate security amplification by composition further by examining the case of four iterations. We quantize a recent technique called the dissection attack using the framework of quantum walks.

  abstract = {In a previous work arXiv:1403.6102, we recently proposed R\'enyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information, which were shown to satisfy some properties that hold for the original quantity, such as non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity under local operations on the system $B$ (with it being left open to show that the R\'enyi quantity is monotone under local operations on system $A$). We also defined a R\'enyi squashed entanglement and a R\'enyi quantum discord based upon a R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual information. Here, we investigate these quantities in more detail. Taking as a conjecture that the R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual information is monotone under local operations on both systems $A$ and $B$, we prove that the R\'enyi squashed entanglement and the R\'enyi quantum discord defined in our prior work satisfy many of the properties of the respective original von Neumann entropy-based quantities. In arXiv:1403.6102, we also detailed a procedure to obtain R\'enyi generalizations of any quantum information measure that is equal to a linear combination of von Neumann entropies with coefficients chosen from the set $\{-1,0,1\}$. Here, we extend this procedure to include differences of relative entropies. Using the extended procedure and a conjectured monotonicity of the R\'enyi generalizations in the R\'enyi parameter, we discuss potential remainder terms for well known inequalities such as monotonicity of the relative entropy, joint convexity of the relative entropy, and the Holevo bound.},

  abstract = {Higher transmission loss diminishes the performance of optical communication|be it the rate at which classical or quantum data can be sent reliably, or the secure key generation rate of quantum key distribution (QKD). Loss compounds with distance|exponentially in an optical fiber, and inverse-square with distance for a free-space channel. In order to boost classical communication rates over long distances, it is customary to introduce regenerative relays at intermediate points along the channel. It is therefore natural to speculate whether untended regenerative stations, such as phase-insensitive or phase-sensitive optical amplifiers, could serve as repeaters for long-distance QKD. The primary result of this paper rules out all bosonic Gaussian channels to be useful as QKD repeaters, which include phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive amplifiers as special cases, for any QKD protocol. We also delineate the conditions under which a Gaussian relay renders a lossy channel entanglement breaking, which in turn makes the channel useless for QKD.},

  abstract = {Pure states are very important in any theory since they represent states of maximal information about the system within the theory. Here, we show that no non-trivial (not local realistic) extremal states (boxes) of general no-signaling theories can be realized within quantum theory. We then explore three interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are uncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against the most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure key generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the interesting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local correlations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new information-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum correlations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on arbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the possibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling correlations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also forms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum winning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique non-signaling winning strategy. We illustrate each of these consequences with the example of generalized Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.},

It is shown that the LHP for TIM on degree-3 graphs is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the LHP for general k-local `stoquastic' Hamiltonians with any constant $k\ge 2$. This result implies that estimating the ground state energy of TIM on degree-3 graphs is a complete problem for the complexity class StoqMA - an extension of the classical class MA. As a corollary, we complete the complexity classification of 2-local Hamiltonians with a fixed set of interactions proposed recently by Cubitt and Montanaro. Secondly, we study quantum annealing algorithms for finding ground states of classical spin Hamiltonians associated with hard optimization problems. We prove that the quantum annealing with TIM Hamiltonians is equivalent modulo polynomial reductions to the quantum annealing with a certain subclass of k-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. This subclass includes all Hamiltonians representable as a sum of a k-local diagonal Hamiltonian and a 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonian.},

The problem of executing a gate in this framework can be posed as the problem of braiding quasiparticles. Because these are not Abelian, the problem can be reduced to finding an optimal product of braid generators where the optimality is defined in terms of the gate approximation and the braid's length. In this paper we propose the use of different variants of estimation of distribution algorithms to deal with the problem. Furthermore, we investigate how the regularities of the braid optimization problem can be translated into statistical regularities by means of the Boltzmann distribution. We show that our best algorithm is able to produce many solutions that approximates the target gate with an accuracy in the order of $10^{-6}$, and have lengths up to 9 times shorter than those expected from braids of the same accuracy obtained with other methods.},

Therefore, in our second approach we eliminate the noise by deriving a related hierarchy of density matrices.

This model has found numerous applications in many areas of computer science. One question that has received a lot of attention recently is whether it is possible to perform such protocols in a private way. We show that defining privacy for quantum protocols is not so straightforward and it depends on whether we assume that the registers where Alice and Bob receive their classical inputs are in fact classical registers (and hence unentangled with the rest of the protocol) or quantum registers (and hence can be entangled with the rest of the protocol or the environment). We provide new quantum protocols for the Inner Product function and for Private Information Retrieval, and show that the privacy assuming classical input registers can be exponentially smaller than the privacy assuming quantum input registers. We also argue that the right notion of privacy of a communication protocol is the one assuming classical input registers, since otherwise the players can deviate considerably from the protocol.},

  abstract = {Topologically ordered phases of matter, in particular so-called symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases, can exhibit quantum number fractionalization in the presence of global symmetry. In Z_2 topologically ordered states in two dimensions, fundamental translations T_x and T_y acting on anyons can either commute or anticommute. This property, crystal momentum fractionalization, can be seen in a periodicity of the excited-state spectrum in the Brillouin zone. We present a numerical method to detect the presence of this form of symmetry enrichment given a projected entangled pair state (PEPS); we study the minima of spectrum of correlation lengths of the transfer matrix for a cylinder. As a benchmark, we demonstrate our method using a modified toric code model with perturbation. An enhanced periodicity in momentum clearly reveals the anticommutation relation {T_x,T_y}=0$ for the corresponding quasiparticles in the system.},

  abstract = {Deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit (DQC1) [E. Knill and R. Laflamme, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf81}, 5672 (1998)] is a restricted model of quantum computing where the input state is the completely-mixed state except for a single pure qubit, and a single output qubit is measured at the end of the computing. We can generalize it to the DQC$k_m$ model where $k$ input qubits are pure, and $m$ output qubits are measured. It was shown in [T. Morimae, K. Fujii, and J. F. Fitzsimons, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf112}, 130502 (2014)] that if the output probability distribution of the DQC1$_m$ model for $m\ge3$ can be classically efficiently sampled, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses at the third level. In this paper, we show that the classical simulability of the DQC$1_2$ model or DQC2$_1$ model also leads to the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy at the third level. Our idea which solves the problem of the "shortage of postselected qubits" is to use the complexity class SBQP instead of postBQP.},

First, we show that there exists a commuting quantum circuit that is not classically simulatable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. This is the first formal evidence that a commuting quantum circuit is not classically simulatable even when the number of output qubits is exponentially small. Then, we consider a generalized version of the circuit and clarify the condition under which it is classically simulatable. Lastly, we apply the argument for the above evidence to Clifford circuits in a similar setting and provide evidence that such a circuit augmented by a depth-1 non-Clifford layer is not classically simulatable.

  abstract = {Relations of simulated annealing and quantum annealing are studied by a mapping from the transition matrix of classical Markovian dynamics of the Ising model to a quantum Hamiltonian and vice versa. It is shown that these two operators, the transition matrix and the Hamiltonian, share the eigenvalue spectrum. Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not encounter a difficulty caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a first-order phase transition, the same is true for the corresponding process of quantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important differences between the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical mapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped to a short-range quantum system, but the converse mapping from a short-range quantum system to a classical one results in long-range interactions. This leads to a difference in efficiencies that simulated annealing can be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily true. We conclude that quantum annealing is easier to implement and is more flexible than simulated annealing. We also point out that the present mapping can be extended to accommodate explicit time dependence of temperature, which is used to justify the quantum-mechanical analysis of simulated annealing by Somma, Batista, and Ortiz. Additionally, an alternative method to solve the non-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional Ising model is provided through the classical-to-quantum mapping.},

  abstract = {Electric-field noise near surfaces is a common problem in diverse areas of physics, and a limiting factor for many precision measurements. There are multiple mechanisms by which such noise is generated, many of which are poorly understood. Laser-cooled, trapped ions provide one of the most sensitive systems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance range 30 - 3000 $\mu$m from the surface. Over recent years numerous experiments have reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion heating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for the observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an extensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in ion traps, and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured mechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of multiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical considerations, complicate the interpretation of these results. It is thus the purpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from the existing data, and which important questions are still open. In so doing it provides a framework for future investigations of surface-noise processes.},

This suggests that graph connectivity (including vertex, edge, algebraic, and normalized algebraic connectivities) is an indicator of fast quantum search, a belief supported by fast quantum search on complete graphs, strongly regular graphs, and hypercubes, all of which are highly connected. In this paper, we show this intuition to be false by giving two examples of graphs for which the opposite holds true: one with low connectivity but fast search, and one with high connectivity but slow search. The second example is a novel two-stage quantum walk algorithm in which the walking rate must be adjusted to yield high search probability.},

This additional constraint leads to stricter requirements than simply imposing locality, in the form of bilocality inequalities. In this work we consider a natural generalisation of the bilocality scenario, namely the star-network consisting of a single central party surrounded by $n$ edge parties, each of which shares an independent source with the centre. We derive new inequalities which are satisfied by all local correlations in this scenario, for the cases when the central party performs (i) two dichotomic measurements (ii) a single Bell state measurement. We demonstrate quantum violations of these inequalities and study both the robustness to noise and to losses.},

  abstract = {In many different fields of science, it is useful to characterize physical states and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory of communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent examples. Questions addressed by a theory of resources include: Which resources can be converted into which other ones? What is the rate at which arbitrarily many copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of another? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible? How does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical definition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable at no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes can be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework. Our abstract characterization of resource theories is a first step in a larger project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. In this vein, we identify a few general results concerning resource convertibility.},

  abstract = {A significant part of quantum theory can be obtained from a single innovation relative to classical theories, namely, that there is a fundamental restriction on the sorts of statistical distributions over physical states that can be prepared. This is termed an "epistemic restriction" because it implies a fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about the physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of epistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical theory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and discrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction called classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all known epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic structure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to an arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a kind of quasi-quantization scheme; "quasi" because it generally only yields a theory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and measurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and because in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is a distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum phenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise in an epistricted theory.},

  abstract = {This work presents a precise connection between Clifford circuits, Shor's factoring algorithm and several other famous quantum algorithms with exponential quantum speed-ups for solving Abelian hidden subgroup problems. We show that all these different forms of quantum computation belong to a common new restricted model of quantum operations that we call \emph{black-box normalizer circuits}. To define these, we extend the previous model of normalizer circuits [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], which are built of quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism and quadratic phase gates associated to an Abelian group $G$. In previous works, the group $G$ is always given in an explicitly decomposed form. In our model, we remove this assumption and allow $G$ to be a black-box group. While standard normalizer circuits were shown to be efficiently classically simulable [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], we find that normalizer circuits are powerful enough to factorize and solve classically-hard problems in the black-box setting. We further set upper limits to their computational power by showing that decomposing finite Abelian groups is complete for the associated complexity class. In particular, solving this problem renders black-box normalizer circuits efficiently classically simulable by exploiting the generalized stabilizer formalism in [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208]. Lastly, we employ our connection to draw a few practical implications for quantum algorithm design: namely, we give a no-go theorem for finding new quantum algorithms with black-box normalizer circuits, a universality result for low-depth normalizer circuits, and identify two other complete problems.},

  abstract = {Integrated photonics promises solutions to questions of stability, complexity, and size in quantum optics. Advances in tunable and non-planar integrated platforms, such laser-inscribed photonics, continue to bring the realisation of quantum advantages in computation and metrology ever closer, perhaps most easily seen in multi-path interferometry. Here we demonstrate control of two-photon interference in a chip-scale 3D multi-path interferometer, showing a reduced periodicity and enhanced visibility compared to single photon measurements. Observed non-classical visibilities are widely tunable, and explained well by theoretical predictions based on classical measurements. With these predictions we extract a Fisher information approaching a theoretical maximum, demonstrating the capability of the device for quantum enhanced phase measurements.},

  abstract = {A way of constructing continuous matrix product states (cMPS) for coupled fields is presented here. The cMPS is a variational \emph{ansatz} for the ground state of quantum field theories in one dimension. Our proposed scheme is based in the physical interpretation in which the cMPS class can be produced by means of a dissipative dynamic of a system interacting with a bath. We study the case of coupled bosonic fields. We test the method with previous DMRG results in coupled Lieb Liniger models. Besides, we discuss a novel application for characterizing the Luttinger liquid theory emerging in the low energy regime of these theories. Finally, we propose a circuit QED architecture as a quantum simulator for coupled fields.},

  abstract = {Correlations in general and entanglement in particular are indispensable resources for numerous quantum information tasks. However, their establishment comes at the cost of energy and is limited by the initial entropy. Here we establish general bounds on the generation of correlations of two arbitrary systems in the presence of a thermal bath, and construct a protocol saturating them. The amount of correlations, quantified by the mutual information, can increase at most linearly with the available energy, and we determine where the linear regime breaks down. We further consider the generation of genuine quantum correlations, focusing on the fundamental constituents of our universe: fermions and bosons. For fermionic modes we find the optimal entangling protocol. For bosonic modes we show that, while Gaussian operations can be outperformed in creating entanglement, their performance is optimal for high available energy.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty relations (URs) like the Heisenberg-Robertson or the time-energy UR are often considered to be hallmarks of quantum theory. Here, a simple derivation of these URs is presented based on a single classical inequality from estimation theory, a Cram\'er-Rao-like bound. The Heisenberg-Robertson UR is then obtained by using the Born rule and the Schr\"odinger equation. This allows a clear separtion of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics from the Hilbert space structure and the dynamical law. It also simplifies the interpretation of the bound. In addition, the Heisenberg-Robertson UR is tightened for mixed states by replacing one variance by the so-called quantum Fisher information. Thermal states of well-known Hamiltonians are shown to saturate the tighter bound for natural choices of the operators. Last, this bound establishes links to inequalities for spin-squeezing and multi-particle entanglement and leads to an entire class of inequalities for entanglement detection.},

Photonic implementations have largely focussed on achieving long distance teleportation due to its suitability for decoherence-free communication. Teleportation also plays a vital role in the scalability of photonic quantum computing, for which large linear optical networks will likely require an integrated architecture. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum teleportation in which all key parts - entanglement preparation, Bell-state analysis and quantum state tomography - are performed on a reconfigurable integrated photonic chip.

  abstract = {Small-scale heat exchanges have recently been modeled with resource theories intended to extend thermodynamics to the nanoscale and quantum regimes. We generalize these theories to exchanges of quantities other than heat, to baths other than heat baths, and to free energies other than the Helmholtz free energy. These generalizations are illustrated with "grand-potential" theories that model movements of heat and particles. Free operations include unitaries that conserve energy and particle number. From this conservation law and from resource-theory principles, the grand-canonical form of the free states is derived. States are shown to form a quasiorder characterized by free operations, d-majorization, the hypothesis-testing entropy, and rescaled Lorenz curves. We calculate the work distillable from, and we bound the work cost of creating, a state. These work quantities can differ but converge to the grand potential in the thermodynamic limit. Extending thermodynamic resource theories beyond heat baths, we open diverse realistic systems to modeling with one-shot statistical mechanics. Prospective applications such as electrochemical batteries are hoped to bridge one-shot theory to experiments.},

In quantum state redistribution as considered in [Luo and Devetak (2009)] and [Devetak and Yard (2008)], there are 4 systems of interest: the A system held by Alice, the B system held by Bob, the C system that is to be transmitted from Alice to Bob, and the R system that holds a purification of the state in the ABC registers. Our bounds are in terms of smooth conditional min- and max- entropies, and the smooth max-information. The protocol for the upper bound has a clear structure, building on the work [Oppenheim (2008)]: it decomposes the quantum state redistribution task into two simpler quantum state merging tasks by introducing a coherent relay. There remains a gap between our upper and lower bounds. This gap vanishes in the independent and identical (iid) asymptotic limit and the remaining terms can then be rewritten as a quantum conditional mutual information, thus yielding an alternative proof of optimality of this communication rate for iid asymptotic quantum state redistribution.},

To do so, we use the fully quantum definition for information cost and complexity that we recently introduced, and use both the fact that information is a lower bound on the communication, and the fact that a direct sum property holds for quantum information complexity. We then give a protocol for compressing a single copy of a protocol down to its quantum information cost, up to terms depending on the number of rounds and the allowed increase in error. Two important tools to derive this protocol are a smooth conditional min-entropy bound for a one-shot quantum state redistribution protocol, and the quantum substate theorem of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen (FOCS'02) to transform this bound into a von Neumann conditional entropy bound. This result further establishes the newly introduced notions of quantum information cost and complexity as the correct quantum generalisations of the classical ones in the standard communication complexity setting. Finding such a quantum generalization of information complexity was one of the open problem recently raised by Braverman (STOC'12).},

For abelian anyon models, we find that the logical action of $U$ is contained in a proper subgroup of the generalized Clifford group. In the case $D(\mathbb{Z}_2)$, which describes Kitaev's toric code, this represents a tightening of statement previously obtained within the stabilizer framework (PRL 110:170503). For non-abelian models, we find that such automorphisms are very limited: for example, there is no non-trivial gate for Fibonacci anyons. For Ising anyons, protected gates are elements of the Pauli group. These results are derived by relating such automorphisms to symmetries of the underlying anyon model: protected gates realize automorphisms of the Verlinde algebra. We additionally use the compatibility with basis changes to characterize the logical action.},

Therefore, simulating the model on planar graphs is as hard as simulating quantum computation. We give two different arguments, demonstrating that the simulation is difficult both for wave packets prepared as excitations of the fermionic vacuum, and for hole wave packets at filling fraction one-half in the limit of strong coupling. In the latter case, which is described by the t-J model, there is only reflection and no transmission in the scattering events, as would be the case for classical hard spheres. In that sense, the construction provides a quantum mechanical analog of the Fredkin-Toffoli billiard ball computer.},

  abstract = {We revisit the evidence for quantum annealing in the D-Wave One device (DW1) based on the study of random Ising instances. Using the probability distributions of finding the ground states of such instances, previous work found agreement with both simulated quantum annealing (SQA) and a classical rotor model. Thus the DW1 ground state success probabilities are consistent with both models, and a different measure is needed to distinguish the data and the models. Here we consider measures that account for ground state degeneracy and the distributions of excited states, and present evidence that for these new measures neither SQA nor the classical rotor model correlate perfectly with the DW1 experiments. We thus provide evidence that SQA and the classical rotor model, both of which are classically efficient algorithms, do not satisfactorily explain all the DW1 data. A complete model for the DW1 remains an open problem. Using the same criteria we find that, on the other hand, SQA and the classical rotor model correlate closely with each other. To explain this we show that the rotor model can be derived as the semiclassical limit of the spin-coherent states path integral. We also find differences in which set of ground states is found by each method, though this feature is sensitive to calibration errors of the DW1 device and to simulation parameters.},

  abstract = {As Landauer's Principle and Szilard's engine illustrate, the reduction of a system's entropy costs work, while its increase can be used to extract work from a heat bath. One consequence in standard thermodynamics is that correlations have work value: the total entropy of two correlated systems is less than the sum of their local entropies, and thus work can be extracted if this correlation is consumed. In this paper, we show that the situation is surprisingly different for microscopic and quantum systems far from the thermodynamic limit: quite the contrary, absence of correlations can be used to extract work. Recently, it has been shown that the possible state transitions in the microscopic regime are severely limited by an infinite family of "second laws". We show that stochastic independence, if consumed as a resource, allows to overcome these limitations, to extract additional work reliably, and to achieve all state transitions that are otherwise only possible in the thermodynamic limit. Our result also yields an operational non-asymptotic characterization of von Neumann (neg-)entropy in terms of a majorization relation which generalizes the trumping relation from entanglement theory.},

In this work, we introduce a more general and conceptually simpler circuit decomposition method that allows for synthesis into protocols that probabilistically implement quantum circuits over several universal gate sets including, but not restricted to, the Clifford+$T$ gate set. The protocol, which we call Probabilistic Quantum Circuits with Fallback (PQF), implements a walk on a discrete Markov chain in which the target unitary is an absorbing state and in which transitions are induced by multi-qubit unitaries followed by measurements. In contrast to RUS protocols, the presented PQF protocols terminate after a finite number of steps. Specifically, we apply our method to the Clifford+$T$, Clifford+$V$, and Clifford+$\pi/12$ gate sets to achieve decompositions with expected gate counts of $\log_b(1/\varepsilon)+O(\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$, where $b$ is a quantity related to the expansion property of the underlying universal gate set.},

Quantum no-signalling correlations are viewed as two-input and two-output completely positive and trace preserving maps with linear constraints enforcing that the device cannot signal. Both problems lead to simple semidefinite programmes (SDPs) that depend only the Kraus operator space of the channel. In particular, we show that the zero-error classical simulation cost is precisely the conditional min-entropy of the Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix of the given channel. The zero-error classical capacity is given by a similar-looking but different SDP; the asymptotic zero-error classical capacity is the regularization of this SDP, and in general we do not know of any simple form. Interestingly however, for the class of classical-quantum channels, we show that the asymptotic capacity is given by a much simpler SDP, which coincides with a semidefinite generalization of the fractional packing number suggested earlier by Aram Harrow. This finally results in an operational interpretation of the celebrated Lovasz $\vartheta$ function of a graph as the zero-error classical capacity of the graph assisted by quantum no-signalling correlations, the first information theoretic interpretation of the Lovasz number.},

  abstract = {We analyze the problem of preparing quantum Gibbs states of lattice spin Hamiltonians with local and commuting terms on a quantum computer and in nature. Our central result is an equivalence between the behavior of correlations in the Gibbs state and the mixing time of the semigroup which drives the system to thermal equilibrium (the Gibbs sampler). We introduce a framework for analyzing the correlation and mixing characteristics of quantum Gibbs states and quantum Gibbs samplers, which is rooted in the theory of non-commutative Lp spaces. We consider two distinct classes of Gibbs samplers, one of which being the well-studied Davies generators modelling the dynamics on the system due to weak-coupling with a large Markovian environment. We show that their gap is independent of system size if, and only if, a certain strong form of clustering of correlations holds in the Gibbs state. As concrete applications of our formalism, we show that for every one-dimensional lattice system, or for systems in lattices of any dimension at high enough temperatures, the Gibbs samplers of commuting Hamiltonians are always gapped, giving an efficient way of preparing these states on a quantum computer.},

While this result has been proved in the standard discrete-time model of quantum computation, it also holds for continuous-time (or Hamiltonian-based) quantum computation, due to a known equivalence between these two query complexity models. In this work, we revisit this result by providing a direct proof in the continuous-time model. One originality of our proof is that it draws new connections between the adversary bound, a modern theoretical computer science technique, and early theorems of quantum mechanics.

In this paper, we examine certain types of symmetric promises, and show that they also cannot give rise to super-polynomial quantum speedups. We conclude that exponential quantum speedups only occur given "structured" promises on the input. Specifically, we show that there is a polynomial relationship of degree $12$ between $D(f)$ and $Q(f)$ for any function $f$ defined on permutations (elements of $\{0,1,\dots, M-1\}^n$ in which each alphabet element occurs exactly once). We generalize this result to all functions $f$ defined on orbits of the symmetric group action $S_n$ (which acts on an element of $\{0,1,\dots, M-1\}^n$ by permuting its entries). We also show that when $M$ is constant, any function $f$ defined on a "symmetric set" - one invariant under $S_n$ - satisfies $R(f)=O(Q(f)^{12(M-1)})$.},

It is known that some constructions are quantum-proof whereas others are provably not [Gavinsky {\it et al.}, STOC'07]. We argue that the theory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what extent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the definition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and then show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely bounded norm condition between operator spaces. Using semidefinite program relaxations of this completely bounded norm, we recover all known stability results for extractors (including the short seeded Trevisan based constructions). Moreover, we show that very high min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always (approximately) quantum-proof. In contrast to these stability results, we find that probabilistic extractor constructions based on random functions give rise to large values of the semidefinite program. We understand this as a hint that even an approximate, but generic stability result for extractors might not be possible.},

Distillation protocols are necessarily non-deterministic and require advanced experimental techniques such as noiseless amplification. Recently it was shown that the benefits of noiseless amplification could be extracted by performing a post-selective filtering of the measurement record to improve the performance of quantum key distribution. We apply this protocol to entanglement degraded by transmission loss of up to the equivalent of 100km of optical fibre. We measure an effective entangled resource stronger than that achievable by even a maximally entangled resource passively transmitted through the same channel. We also provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of secret key extraction from an otherwise insecure regime. The measurement-based noiseless linear amplifier offers two advantages over its physical counterpart: ease of implementation and near optimal probability of success. It should provide an effective and versatile tool for a broad class of entanglement-based quantum communication protocols.},

  abstract = {The study of ground spaces of local Hamiltonians is a fundamental task in condensed matter physics. In terms of computational complexity theory, a common focus has been to estimate a given Hamiltonian's ground state energy. However, from a physics perspective, it is often more relevant to understand the structure of the ground space itself. In this paper, we pursue this latter direction by introducing the physically well-motivated notion of "ground state connectivity" of local Hamiltonians, which captures problems in areas ranging from stabilizer codes to quantum memories. We show that determining how "connected" the ground space of a local Hamiltonian is can range from QCMA-complete to NEXP-complete. As a result, we obtain a natural QCMA-complete problem, a goal which has proven elusive since the conception of QCMA over a decade ago. Our proofs crucially rely on a new technical tool, the Traversal Lemma, which analyzes the Hilbert space a local unitary evolution must traverse under certain conditions, and which we believe may be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {$\textit{Normalizer circuits}$ [1,2] are generalized Clifford circuits that act on arbitrary finite-dimensional systems $\mathcal{H}_{d_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{d_n}$ with a standard basis labeled by the elements of a finite Abelian group $G=\mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times\cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. Normalizer gates implement operations associated with the group $G$ and can be of three types: quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism gates and quadratic phase gates. In this work, we extend the normalizer formalism [1,2] to infinite dimensions, by allowing normalizer gates to act on systems of the form $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}^{\otimes a}$: each factor $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}$ has a standard basis labeled by $\textit{integers}$ $\mathbb{Z}$, and a Fourier basis labeled by $\textit{angles}$, elements of the circle group $\mathbb{T}$. Normalizer circuits become hybrid quantum circuits acting both on continuous- and discrete-variable systems. We show that infinite-dimensional normalizer circuits can be efficiently simulated classically with a generalized $\textit{stabilizer formalism}$ for Hilbert spaces associated with groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}^a\times \mathbb{T}^b \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. We develop new techniques to track stabilizer-groups based on normal forms for group automorphisms and quadratic functions. We use our normal forms to reduce the problem of simulating normalizer circuits to that of finding general solutions of systems of mixed real-integer linear equations [3] and exploit this fact to devise a robust simulation algorithm: the latter remains efficient even in pathological cases where stabilizer groups become infinite, uncountable and non-compact. The techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4,5].},

Recognizing that classical correlations correspond to measurements made on separable states, we also introduce a practical method for obtaining sufficient separability criteria. We specifically vet the candidacy of driven and undriven superradiance as schema for entanglement generation. We conclude by reviewing current approaches to quantum contextuality, emphasizing the operational distinction between nonlocal and contextual quantum statistics. We utilize our abstractly-weighted linear quantum bounds to explicitly demonstrate a set of conditional probability distributions which are simultaneously compatible with quantum contextuality while being incompatible with quantum nonlocality.

  abstract = {One of the most striking features of quantum phases that exhibit topological order is the presence of long range entanglement that cannot be detected by any local order parameter. The formalism of projected entangled-pair states is a natural framework for the parameterization of the corresponding ground state wavefunctions, in which the full wavefunction is encoded in terms of local tensors. Topological order is reflected in the symmetries of these tensors, and we give a characterization of those symmetries in terms of matrix product operators acting on the virtual level. This leads to a set of algebraic rules characterizing states with topological quantum order. The corresponding matrix product operators fully encode all topological features of the theory, and provide a systematic way of constructing topological states. We generalize the conditions of $\mathsf{G}$ and twisted injectivity to the matrix product operator case, and provide a complete picture of the ground state manifold on the torus. As an example, we show how all string-net models of Levin and Wen fit within this formalism, and in doing so provide a particularly intuitive interpretation of the pentagon equation for F-symbols as the pulling of certain matrix product operators through the string-net tensor network. Our approach paves the way to finding novel topological phases beyond string-nets, and elucidates the description of topological phases in terms of entanglement Hamiltonians and edge theories.},

In response, people proposed post-quantum cryptography based on computational problems that are believed hard even for quantum computers. However, security of these schemes against \emph{quantum} attacks is elusive. This is because existing security analysis (almost) only deals with classical attackers and arguing security in the presence of quantum adversaries is challenging due to unique quantum features such as no-cloning. This work proposes a general framework to study which classical security proofs can be restored in the quantum setting. Basically, we split a security proof into (a sequence of) classical security reductions, and investigate what security reductions are "quantum-friendly". We characterize sufficient conditions such that a classical reduction can be "lifted" to the quantum setting. We then apply our lifting theorems to post-quantum signature schemes. We are able to show that the classical generic construction of hash-tree based signatures from one-way functions and and a more efficient variant proposed in~\cite{BDH11} carry over to the quantum setting. Namely, assuming existence of (classical) one-way functions that are resistant to efficient quantum inversion algorithms, there exists a quantum-secure signature scheme. We note that the scheme in~\cite{BDH11} is a promising (post-quantum) candidate to be implemented in practice and our result further justifies it. Finally we demonstrate the generality of our framework by showing that several existing works (Full-Domain hash in the quantum random-oracle model~\cite{Zha12ibe} and the simple hybrid arguments framework in~\cite{HSS11}) can be reformulated under our unified framework.},

  abstract = {Discrete combinatorial optimization consists in finding the optimal configuration that minimizes a given discrete objective function. An interpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us to reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature thermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we present three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit quantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without uncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously prove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum mapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial dimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum system also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be prepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions. This mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between simulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one and introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time required to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a quantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a quadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical simulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic; instead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the corresponding quantum system. For some problems it results in an exponential speedup (in the oracle model) over the best classical algorithms.},

  abstract = {Towards the end of 2011, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolph derived a theorem that aimed to show that the quantum state must be ontic (a state of reality) in a broad class of realist approaches to quantum theory. This result attracted a lot of attention and controversy. The aim of this review article is to review the background to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem, to provide a clear presentation of the theorem itself, and to review related work that has appeared since the publication of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph paper. In particular, this review: Explains what it means for the quantum state to be ontic or epistemic (a state of knowledge); Reviews arguments for and against an ontic interpretation of the quantum state as they existed prior to the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Explains why proving the reality of the quantum state is a very strong constraint on realist theories in that it would imply many of the known no-go theorems, such as Bell's Theorem and the need for an exponentially large ontic state space; Provides a comprehensive presentation of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem itself, along with subsequent improvements and criticisms of its assumptions; Reviews two other arguments for the reality of the quantum state: the first due to Hardy and the second due to Colbeck and Renner, and explains why their assumptions are less compelling than those of the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph Theorem; Reviews subsequent work aimed at ruling out stronger notions of what it means for the quantum state to be epistemic and points out open questions in this area. The overall aim is not only to provide the background needed for the novice in this area to understand the current status, but also to discuss often overlooked subtleties that should be of interest to the experts.},

  abstract = {We study the complexity of a class of problems involving satisfying constraints which remain the same under translations in one or more spatial directions. In this paper, we show hardness of a classical tiling problem on an N x N 2-dimensional grid and a quantum problem involving finding the ground state energy of a 1-dimensional quantum system of N particles. In both cases, the only input is N, provided in binary. We show that the classical problem is NEXP-complete and the quantum problem is QMA_EXP-complete. Thus, an algorithm for these problems which runs in time polynomial in N (exponential in the input size) would imply that EXP = NEXP or BQEXP = QMA_EXP, respectively. Although tiling in general is already known to be NEXP-complete, to our knowledge, all previous reductions require that either the set of tiles and their constraints or some varying boundary conditions be given as part of the input. In the problem considered here, these are fixed, constant-sized parameters of the problem. Instead, the problem instance is encoded solely in the size of the system.},

The nature of weak measurements, as well as the presence of post-selection and hence possible contribution of measurement-disturbance, has led to a long-running debate about whether or not this is surprising. Here, it is shown that such "anomalous weak values" are non-classical in a precise sense: a sufficiently weak measurement of one constitutes a proof of contextuality. This clarifies, for example, which features must be present (and in an experiment, verified) to demonstrate an effect with no satisfying classical explanation.},

In this work, we establish a novel link between dynamical properties - the absence of a group velocity and transport - with entanglement properties of individual eigenvectors. Using Lieb-Robinson bounds and filter functions, we prove rigorously under simple assumptions on the spectrum that if a system shows strong dynamical localisation, all of its many-body eigenvectors have clustering correlations. In one dimension this implies directly an entanglement area law, hence the eigenvectors can be approximated by matrix-product states. We also show this statement for parts of the spectrum, allowing for the existence of a mobility edge above which transport is possible.},

We build upon these results by showing that a small quantum simulators can be used to characterize and learn control models for larger devices for wide classes of physically realistic Hamiltonians. This leads to a new application for small quantum computers: characterizing and controlling larger quantum computers. Our protocol achieves this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb-Robinson bounds and interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for characterization. Whereas Fisher information analysis shows that current methods which employ short-time evolution are suboptimal, interactive quantum learning allows us to overcome this limitation. We illustrate the efficiency of our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8-qubit Ising model simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data.},

  abstract = {The new field of quantum error correction has developed spectacularly since its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10^6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10^{-6}, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks.

  abstract = {Quantum states are very delicate, so it is likely some sort of quantum error correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below some constant threshold value.},

This entropy measures the average conditional mixedness of the post-measurement state of the qudit, and its minimum among all local measurements represents a generalized entanglement of formation. In the case of the von Neumann entropy, it is directly related to the quantum discord. It is shown that at the lowest non-trivial order, the problem reduces to the minimization of a quadratic form determined by the correlation tensor of the system, the Bloch vector of the qubit and the local concavity of the entropy, requiring just the diagonalization of a $3\times 3$ matrix. A simple geometrical picture in terms of an associated correlation ellipsoid is also derived, which illustrates the link between entropy optimization and correlation access and which is exact for a quadratic entropy. The approach enables a simple estimation of the quantum discord. Illustrative results for two-qubit states are discussed.},

  abstract = {We study the +/- J random-plaquette Z_2 gauge model (RPGM) in three spatial dimensions, a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional +/- J random-bond Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the ``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the temperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0}, the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding p_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding p_{c0}=.1031 +/-.0001. Our value of p_{c0} is incompatible with the value of p_c=.1093 +/-.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in disagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is vertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line.},

In case of degeneracy a modified selection rule is conjectured and its validity is supported. As a consequence the recently found effect of quasipinning is physically relevant in the sense that its occurrence allows to approximately reconstruct $|\Psi_N\rangle$, its entanglement properties and correlations from 1-particle information.

We provide lower bounds on the entropy of 2-design ensembles and measurements, from which upper bounds on their accessible information and informational power follow, as a function of the dimension only. We show that the statistics generated by 2-designs, although optimal for the abovementioned protocols, never contains more than one bit of information. Finally, we specialize our results to the relevant cases of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) sets and maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), and we generalize them to the arbitrary-rank case.},

  abstract = {Recently, a variety of new measures of quantum Renyi mutual information and quantum Renyi conditional entropy have been proposed, and some of their mathematical properties explored. Here, we show that the Renyi mutual information attains operational meaning in the context of composite hypothesis testing, when the null hypothesis is a fixed bipartite state and the alternate hypothesis consists of all product states that share one marginal with the null hypothesis. This hypothesis testing problem occurs naturally in channel coding, where it corresponds to testing whether a state is the output of a given quantum channel or of a 'useless' channel whose output is decoupled from the environment. Similarly, we establish an operational interpretation of Renyi conditional entropy by choosing an alternative hypothesis that consists of product states that are maximally mixed on one system. Specialized to classical probability distributions, our results also establish an operational interpretation of Renyi mutual information and Renyi conditional entropy.},

The definition of the $\alpha$-$z$-relative R\'{e}nyi entropy unifies all previously proposed definitions of the quantum R\'{e}nyi divergence of order $\alpha$ under a common framework. Here we will prove that the $\alpha$-$z$-relative R\'{e}nyi entropies are a proper generalization of the quantum relative entropy by computing the limit of the $\alpha$-$z$ divergence as $\alpha$ approaches one and $z$ is an arbitrary function of $\alpha$. We also show that certain operationally relevant families of R\'enyi divergences are differentiable at $\alpha = 1$. Finally, our analysis reveals that the derivative at $\alpha = 1$ evaluates to half the relative entropy variance, a quantity that has attained operational significance in second-order quantum hypothesis testing.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

The new code belongs to the class of subsystem stabilizer codes. It inherits many favorable properties of the standard surface code such as encoding of multiple logical qubits on a planar lattice with punctured holes, efficient decoding by either minimum-weight matching or renormalization group methods, and high error threshold. The new subsystem surface code (SSC) gives rise to an exactly solvable Hamiltonian with 3-qubit interactions, topologically ordered ground state, and a constant energy gap. We construct a local unitary transformation mapping the SSC Hamiltonian to the one of the ordinary surface code thus showing that the two Hamiltonians belong to the same topological class. We describe error correction protocols for the SSC and determine its error thresholds under several natural error models. In particular, we show that the SSC has error threshold approximately 0.6% for the standard circuit-based error model studied in the literature. We also consider a model in which three-qubit parity operators can be measured directly. We show that the SSC has error threshold approximately 0.97% in this setting.},

An important goal, therefore, is to minimize the amount of resources required to implement quantum algorithms, many of which are serial in nature and leave large numbers of qubits idle much of the time unless compression techniques are used. Furthermore, quantum error-correcting codes, which are required to reduce the effects of noise, introduce additional resource overhead. We consider a strategy for quantum circuit optimization based on topological deformation in the surface code, one of the best performing and most practical quantum error-correcting codes.

This approach allows us to go beyond the standard stochastic error model commonly used to quantify decoherence and error threshold probabilities in this system. The full quantum mechanical system-bath dynamics is computed exactly over one quantum error correction cycle. Since all physical qubits interact with the bath, space-time correlations between errors are taken into account. We compute the fidelity of the surface code as a function of the quantum error correction time. The calculation allows us to map the problem onto an Ising-like statistical spin model with two-body interactions and a fictitious temperature which is related to the inverse bath coupling constant. The model departs from the usual Ising model in the sense that interactions can be long ranged and can involve complex exchange couplings; in addition, the number of allowed configurations is restricted by the syndrome extraction. Using analytical estimates and numerical calculations, we argue that, in the limit of an infinite number of physical qubits, the spin model sustain a phase transition which can be associated to the existence of an error threshold in the surface code. An estimate of the transition point is given for the case of nearest-neighbor interactions.},

A universal signature of this phase is topological entanglement entropy (TEE), but due to low signal to noise, it is extremely difficult to observe in these systems, and one usually resorts to measuring anyonic statistics of excitations or non-local string operators to reveal the order. We describe a continuous-variable analog to the surface code using quantum harmonic oscillators on a two-dimensional lattice, which has the distinctive property of needing only two-body nearest-neighbor interactions for its creation. Though such a model is gapless, satisfies an area law, and the ground state can be simply prepared by measurements on a finitely squeezed and gapped two-dimensional cluster state, which does not have topological order. Asymptotically, the TEE grows linearly with the squeezing parameter, and we show that its mixed-state generalization, the topological mutual information, is robust to some forms of state preparation error and can be detected simply using single-mode quadrature measurements. Finally, we discuss scalable implementation of these methods using optical and circuit-QED technology.},

We identify the quantities which are playing the role of the concurrence, the three-tangle and the invariant $\det \rho_A+\det \rho_B+\det \rho_C$ for this tripartite system. We show that this latter one is almost interchangeable with the von Neumann entropy and conjecture that it measures the entanglement of one fermion with the rest of the system. We prove that the vanishing of the fermionic "concurrence" implies that the two particle reduced density matrix is a mixture of separable states. Also the vanishing of this quantitiy is only possible in the GHZ class, where some genuie tripartite entanglement is present and in the separable class. Based on this we conjecture that this "concurrence" measures the amount of entanglement between pairs of fermions. We identify the well-known "spin-flipped" density matrix in the fermionic context as the reduced density matrix of a special particle-hole dual state. We show that in general this dual state is always canonically defined by the Hermitian inner product of the fermionic Fock space and that it can be used to calculate SLOCC covariants. We show that Fierz identities known from the theory of spinors relate SLOCC covariants with reduced density matrix elements of the state and its "spin-flipped" dual.},

We give a method to obtain planar homological codes based on the construction of quantum codes on compact surfaces without boundaries. We show how the original Shor's 9-qubit code can be visualized as a homological quantum code. We study the problem of constructing quantum codes with optimal encoding rate. In the particular case of toric codes we construct an optimal family and give an explicit proof of its optimality. For homological quantum codes on surfaces of arbitrary genus we also construct a family of codes asymptotically attaining the maximum possible encoding rate.

Lett. 98, 220503 (2007), quant-ph/0609149]. Our method makes use of tools from many-body physics - matrix product states, finitely correlated states or projected entangled pairs states - to show how measurements on entangled states can be viewed as processing quantum information. This work hence constitutes an instance where a quantum information problem - how to realize quantum computation - was approached using tools from many-body theory and not vice versa. We give a more detailed description of the setting, and present a large number of new examples. We find novel computational schemes, which differ from the original one-way computer for example in the way the randomness of measurement outcomes is handled. Also, schemes are presented where the logical qubits are no longer strictly localized on the resource state. Notably, we find a great flexibility in the properties of the universal resource states: They may for example exhibit non-vanishing long-range correlation functions or be locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. We discuss variants of Kitaev's toric code states as universal resources, and contrast this with situations where they can be efficiently classically simulated. This framework opens up a way of thinking of tailoring resource states to specific physical systems, such as cold atoms in optical lattices or linear optical systems.},

  abstract = {In this short review, I draw attention to new developments in the theory of fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete direction to future work in the development of superconducting qubit systems. The basics of quantum error correction codes, which I will briefly review, have not significantly changed since their introduction fifteen years ago. But an interesting picture has emerged of an efficient use of these codes that may put fault tolerant operation within reach. It is now understood that two dimensional surface codes, close relatives of the original toric code of Kitaev, can be adapted to effectively perform logical gate operations in a very simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault tolerant operation simulated to be 0.75%. This architecture uses topological ideas in its functioning, but it is not 'topological quantum computation' -- there are no non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.},

  abstract = {The ability to protect quantum information from the effect of noise is one of the major goals of quantum information processing. In this article, we study limitations on the asymptotic stability of quantum information stored in passive N-qubit systems. We consider the effect of small imperfections in the implementation of the protecting Hamiltonian in the form of perturbations or weak coupling to a ground state environment. We prove that, regardless of the protecting Hamiltonian, there exists a perturbed evolution that necessitates a final error correcting step when the state of the memory is read. Such an error correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof being exemplified by the 3D compass model. We go on to present explicit weak Hamiltonian perturbations which destroy the logical information stored in the 2D toric code in a time O(log(N)).},

  abstract = {The Turaev-Viro invariant for a closed 3-manifold is defined as the contraction of a certain tensor network. The tensors correspond to tetrahedra in a triangulation of the manifold, with values determined by a fixed spherical category. For a manifold with boundary, the tensor network has free indices that can be associated to qudits, and its contraction gives the coefficients of a quantum error-correcting code. The code has local stabilizers determined by Levin and Wen. For example, applied to the genus-one handlebody using the Z_2 category, this construction yields the well-known toric code. For other categories, such as the Fibonacci category, the construction realizes a non-abelian anyon model over a discrete lattice. By studying braid group representations acting on equivalence classes of colored ribbon graphs embedded in a punctured sphere, we identify the anyons, and give a simple recipe for mapping fusion basis states of the doubled category to ribbon graphs. We explain how suitable initial states can be prepared efficiently, how to implement braids, by successively changing the triangulation using a fixed five-qudit local unitary gate, and how to measure the topological charge. Combined with known universality results for anyonic systems, this provides a large family of schemes for quantum computation based on local deformations of stabilizer codes. These schemes may serve as a starting point for developing fault-tolerance schemes using continuous stabilizer measurements and active error-correction.},

  abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance 3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.},

  abstract = {Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories are of central importance in many areas of physics. In condensed matter physics, Abelian U(1) lattice gauge theories arise in the description of certain quantum spin liquids. In quantum information theory, Kitaev's toric code is a Z(2) lattice gauge theory. In particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, is non-perturbatively regularized on a lattice. Quantum link models extend the concept of lattice gauge theories beyond the Wilson formulation, and are well suited for both digital and analog quantum simulation using ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices. Since quantum simulators do not suffer from the notorious sign problem, they open the door to studies of the real-time evolution of strongly coupled quantum systems, which are impossible with classical simulation methods. A plethora of interesting lattice gauge theories suggests itself for quantum simulation, which should allow us to address very challenging problems, ranging from confinement and deconfinement, or chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite baryon density, to color superconductivity and the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, first in simpler model gauge theories and ultimately in QCD.},

We furthermore show how basic properties of M-spaces can transparently be understood by manipulating their monomial stabilizer groups. In particular we derive a unified procedure to construct an eigenbasis of any M-space, yielding an explicit formula for each of the eigenstates. We also discuss the computational complexity of M-spaces and show that basic problems, such as estimating local expectation values, are NP-hard. Finally we prove that a large subclass of M-spaces---containing in particular most of the aforementioned examples---can be simulated efficiently classically with a unified method.},

  abstract = {Perturbative gadgets are used to construct a quantum Hamiltonian whose low-energy subspace approximates a given quantum $k$-body Hamiltonian up to an absolute error $\epsilon$. Typically, gadget constructions involve terms with large interaction strengths of order $\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1})$. Here we present a 2-body gadget construction and prove that it approximates a target many-body Hamiltonian of interaction strength $\gamma = O(1)$ up to absolute error $\epsilon\ll\gamma$ using interactions of strength $O(\epsilon)$ instead of the usual inverse polynomial in $\epsilon$. A key component in our proof is a new condition for the convergence of the perturbation series, allowing our gadget construction to be applied in parallel on multiple many-body terms. We also show how to apply this gadget construction for approximating 3- and $k$-body Hamiltonians. The price we pay for using much weaker interactions is a large overhead in the number of ancillary qubits, and the number of interaction terms per particle, both of which scale as $O(\text{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}))$. Our strong-from-weak gadgets have their primary application in complexity theory (QMA hardness of restricted Hamiltonians, a generalized area law counterexample, gap amplification), but could also motivate practical implementations with many weak interactions simulating a much stronger quantum many-body interaction.},

Here, we overcome this difficulty by using the replica method, a tool borrowed from statistical physics and quantum field theory. We find a first application of this method to the field of quantum optics, where it enables accessing the entropic characteristics of the Bogoliubov transformation effected by a two-mode squeezer or optical amplifier.

This is because entanglement across channel uses can increase the coherent information, even from zero to non-zero! However, in all known examples, at least to detect whether the capacity is non-zero, two channel uses already suffice. Maybe a finite number of channel uses is always sufficient?

  abstract = {We propose a new method for proving lower bounds on quantum query algorithms. Instead of a classical adversary that runs the algorithm with one input and then modifies the input, we use a quantum adversary that runs the algorithm with a superposition of inputs. If the algorithm works correctly, its state becomes entangled with the superposition over inputs. We bound the number of queries needed to achieve a sufficient entanglement and this implies a lower bound on the number of queries for the computation. Using this method, we prove two new $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ lower bounds on computing AND of ORs and inverting a permutation and also provide more uniform proofs for several known lower bounds which have been previously proven via variety of different techniques.},

  abstract = {Adiabatic quantum transistors allow quantum logic gates to be performed by applying a large field to a quantum many-body system prepared in its ground state, without the need for local control. The basic operation of such a device can be viewed as driving a spin chain from a symmetry protected phase to a trivial phase, and this perspective offers an avenue to generalise the adiabatic quantum transistor and to design several improvements. The performance of quantum logic gates is shown to depend only on universal symmetry properties of a symmetry-protected phase rather than fine tuned parent Hamiltonians, and it is possible to implement a universal set of logic gates in this way by combining several different types of symmetry protected matter. Such symmetry-protected adiabatic quantum transistors are argued to be robust to a range of relevant noise processes.},

  abstract = {The self-consistent field method utilized for solving the Hartree-Fock (HF) problem and the closely related Kohn-Sham problem, is typically thought of as one of the cheapest methods available to quantum chemists. This intuition has been developed from the numerous applications of the self-consistent field method to a large variety of molecular systems. However, in terms of its worst-case computational complexity, the HF problem is NP-complete. In this work, we investigate how far one can push the boundaries of the NP-completeness by investigating restricted instances of HF. We have constructed two new NP-complete variants of the problem. The first is a set of Hamiltonians whose translationally invariant Hartree-Fock solutions are trivial, but whose broken symmetry solutions are NP-complete. Second, we demonstrate how to embed instances of spin glasses into translationally invariant Hartree-Fock instances and provide a numerical example. These findings are the first steps towards understanding in which cases the self-consistent field method is computationally feasible and when it is not.},

  abstract = {Nonlocality enables two parties to win specific games with probabilities strictly higher than allowed by any classical theory. Nevertheless, all known such examples consider games where the two parties have a common interest, since they jointly win or lose the game. The main question we ask here is whether the nonlocal feature of quantum mechanics can offer an advantage in a scenario where the two parties have conflicting interests. We answer this in the affirmative by presenting a simple conflicting interest game, where quantum strategies outperform classical ones. Moreover, we show that our game has a fair quantum equilibrium with higher payoffs for both players than in any fair classical equilibrium. Finally, we play the game using a commercial entangled photon source and demonstrate experimentally the quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {We propose two distinct methods of improving quantum computing protocols based on surface codes. First, we analyze the use of dislocations instead of holes to produce logical qubits, potentially reducing spacetime volume required. Dislocations induce defects which, in many respects, behave like Majorana quasi-particles. We construct circuits to implement these codes and present fault-tolerant measurement methods for these and other defects which may reduce spatial overhead. One advantage of these codes is that Hadamard gates take exactly $0$ time to implement. We numerically study the performance of these codes using a minimum weight and a greedy decoder using finite-size scaling. Second, we consider state injection of arbitrary ancillas to produce arbitrary rotations. This avoids the logarithmic (in precision) overhead in online cost required if $T$ gates are used to synthesize arbitrary rotations. While this has been considered before, we consider also the parallel performance of this protocol. Arbitrary ancilla injection leads to a probabilistic protocol in which there is a constant chance of success on each round; we use an amortized analysis to show that even in a parallel setting this leads to only a constant factor slowdown as opposed to the logarithmic slowdown that might be expected naively.},

  abstract = {Given a random permutation $f: [N] \to [N]$ as a black box and $y \in [N]$, we want to output $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Supplementary to our input, we are given classical advice in the form of a pre-computed data structure; this advice can depend on the permutation but \emph{not} on the input $y$. Classically, there is a data structure of size $\tilde{O}(S)$ and an algorithm that with the help of the data structure, given $f(x)$, can invert $f$ in time $\tilde{O}(T)$, for every choice of parameters $S$, $T$, such that $S\cdot T \ge N$. We prove a quantum lower bound of $T^2\cdot S \ge \tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon N)$ for quantum algorithms that invert a random permutation $f$ on an $\epsilon$ fraction of inputs, where $T$ is the number of queries to $f$ and $S$ is the amount of advice. This answers an open question of De et al. We also give a $\Omega(\sqrt{N/m})$ quantum lower bound for the simpler but related Yao's box problem, which is the problem of recovering a bit $x_j$, given the ability to query an $N$-bit string $x$ at any index except the $j$-th, and also given $m$ bits of advice that depend on $x$ but not on $j$.},

  abstract = {One of the main concepts in quantum physics is a density matrix, which is a symmetric positive definite matrix of trace one. Finite probability distributions are a special case where the density matrix is restricted to be diagonal. Density matrices are mixtures of dyads, where a dyad has the form uu' for any any unit column vector u. These unit vectors are the elementary events of the generalized probability space. Perhaps the simplest case to see that something unusual is going on is the case of uniform density matrix, i.e. 1/n times identity. This matrix assigns probability 1/n to every unit vector, but of course there are infinitely many of them. The new normalization rule thus says that sum of probabilities over any orthonormal basis of directions is one. We develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions that includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate these, i.e. analogs of the theorem of total probability, various Bayes rules for the calculation of posterior density matrices, etc. The resulting calculus parallels the familiar 'classical' probability calculus and always retains the latter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal. Whereas the classical Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which model is 'best', the generalization maintains uncertainty about which unit direction has the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds also generalize: as in the classical setting we bound the negative log likelihood of the data by the negative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.},

  abstract = {Shor's factoring algorithm (SFA) finds the prime factors of a number, $N=p_1 p_2$, exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. Responsible for the speed-up is a subroutine called the quantum order finding algorithm (QOFA) which calculates the order -- the smallest integer, $r$, satisfying $a^r \mod N =1$, where $a$ is a randomly chosen integer coprime to $N$ (in other words their greatest common divisor is one, $\gcd(a, N) =1$). Given $r$ the factors can usually be found: with probability not less than $1/2$, they are given by $p_1 = \gcd (a^{\frac{r}{2}} - 1, N)$ and $p_2 = \gcd (a^{\frac{r}{2}} + 1, N)$. When the QOFA returns an odd value of $r$ it is assumed the factors cannot be found (since $a^{\frac{r}{2}}$ is not generally integer) and the QOFA is relaunched with a different value of $a$. But a recent paper [E. Martin-Lopez et al., Nat Photon 6, 773 (2012)] (to which the author contributed) noted that the factors can sometimes be found from odd orders if the coprime is square. Here, we explain the role of odd orders in factoring. A natural question is "does considering odd values of $r$ improve the probability of success of SFA?" We show that not discarding them -- and using a second observation, that failure using a square coprimes sometimes implies a new order finding relation -- does, indeed, increase the probability of factoring, although only slightly. Even so, small improvements in the efficiency of the quantum algorithm may give substantial reductions in overall run-time, especially while quantum computations remain much harder to do than classical ones.},

Measurement-device-independent QKD (MDIQKD) protocol is immune to all these attacks and thus a strong candidate for network security.

Besides, they need manual calibration frequently to maintain the system performance. These aspects render these demonstrations far from practicability. Thus, justification is extremely crucial for practical deployment into the field environment.

  abstract = {The success of the abstract model of computation, in terms of bits, logical operations, programming language constructs, and the like, makes it easy to forget that computation is a physical process. Our cherished notions of computation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the physics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to ask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of a classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of computation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel cryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small quantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are underway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices, the quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight into the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of the physics of our universe and its connections with computation. We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of a quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of a number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and highlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena described were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was quantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more dramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these oddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe next. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for future work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum information ultimately comes from.},

  abstract = {Weak value amplification, a 25 five years old technique used in metrology applications, has proved to be highly successful for measuring extremely tiny changes of a variable of interest. In spite of this, in what sense the technique is useful is still a question of debate. Here we show, making use of simple ideas taken from quantum estimation theory, what is the main contribution of the concept of weak value amplification to metrology. On the one hand, since the technique makes use of linear-optics unitary operations, it cannot modify the statistics of photons involved, and therefore, its capabilities are still fundamentally limited by the quantum nature of the light used. On the other hand, in certain scenarios weak value amplification can effectively enhance the sensitivity of real non-ideal detection schemes that might be limited by many other things apart from the specific characteristics of the light, i.e. technical noise. Importantly, it can do that in a straightforward and easily accessible manner.},

  abstract = {Recently, Bravyi and K\"onig have shown that there is a tradeoff between fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates and geometric locality of stabilizer codes. They consider locality-preserving operations which are implemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus fault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they shown that, for local stabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are restricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions and applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we present a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we prove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a locality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a macroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a D-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with non-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and Terhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial transversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such, no family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of the Clifford hierarchy may exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer and subsystem codes, and is not restricted to geometrically-local codes. Fourth we extend the result of Bravyi and K\"onig to subsystem codes. A technical difficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not apply to subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming the presence of error threshold in a subsystem code, and the same conclusion as Bravyi-K\"onig is recovered.},

The first variant is one in which the verifier sends a short message to the prover, and the prover responds with an ordinary, or polynomial-length, message; the second variant is one in which any number of messages can be exchanged, but where the combined length of all the messages is logarithmic; and the third variant is one in which the verifier sends polynomially many random bits to the prover, who responds with a short quantum message. We prove that in all of these cases the short messages can be eliminated without changing the power of the model, so the first variant has the expressive power of QMA and the second and third variants have the expressive power of BQP. These facts are proved through the use of quantum state tomography, along with the finite quantum de Finetti theorem for the first variant.},

Using this framework we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions when two different groups give the same anyon types. As an application we show that in the quantum double model for S_3 (the permutation group over three letters) there is a chargeon and a fluxion which are not distinguishable. This group is indeed a special case of groups of the form of the semidirect product of the additive and multiplicative groups of a finite field, for all of which we prove a similar symmetry.},

We ask how entangled the ground state of a FF quantum spin-s chain with nearest-neighbor interactions can be for small values of s. While FF spin-1/2 chains are known to have unentangled ground states, the case s=1 remains less explored. We propose the first example of a FF translation-invariant spin-1 chain that has a unique highly entangled ground state and exhibits some signatures of a critical behavior. The ground state can be viewed as the uniform superposition of balanced strings of left and right parentheses separated by empty spaces. Entanglement entropy of one half of the chain scales as log(n)/2 + O(1), where n is the number of spins. We prove that the energy gap above the ground state is polynomial in 1/n. The proof relies on a new result concerning statistics of Dyck paths which might be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {The sub-volume scaling of the entanglement entropy with the system's size, $n$, has been a subject of vigorous study in the last decade [1]. The area law provably holds for gapped one dimensional systems [2] and it was believed to be violated by at most a factor of $\log\left(n\right)$ in physically reasonable models such as critical systems. In this paper, we generalize the spin$-1$ model of Bravyi et al [3] to all integer spin-$s$ chains, whereby we introduce a class of exactly solvable models that are physical and exhibit signatures of criticality, yet violate the area law by a power law. The proposed Hamiltonian is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. We prove that it is frustration free and has a unique ground state. Moreover, we prove that the energy gap scales as $n^{-c}$, where using the theory of Brownian excursions, we prove $c\ge2$. This rules out the possibility of these models being described by a conformal field theory. We analytically show that the Schmidt rank grows exponentially with $n$ and that the half-chain entanglement entropy to the leading order scales as $\sqrt{n}$ (Eq. 16). Geometrically, the ground state is seen as a uniform superposition of all $s-$colored Motzkin walks. Lastly, we introduce an external field which allows us to remove the boundary terms yet retain the desired properties of the model. Our techniques for obtaining the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy, the gap upper bound and the self-contained expositions of the combinatorial techniques, more akin to lattice paths, may be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {We study entanglement harvested from a quantum field through local interaction with Unruh-DeWitt detectors undergoing linear acceleration. The interactions allow entanglement to be swapped locally from the field to the detectors. We find an enhancement in the entanglement harvesting by two detectors with anti-parallel acceleration over those with inertial motion. This enhancement is characterized by the presence of entanglement between two detectors that would otherwise maintain a separable state in the absence of relativistic motion (with the same distance of closest approach in both cases). We also find that entanglement harvesting is degraded for two detectors undergoing parallel acceleration in the same way as for two static, comoving detectors in a de Sitter universe. This degradation is known to be different from that of two inertial detectors in a thermal bath. We comment on the physical origin of the harvested entanglement and present three methods for determining distance between two detectors using properties of the harvested entanglement. Information about the separation is stored nonlocally in the joint state of the accelerated detectors after the interaction; a single detector alone contains none. We also find an example of entanglement sudden death exhibited in parameter space.},

The present analysis starts from a careful consideration these "finite-precision" approximations. A stronger condition for non-contextual models, dubbed <ontological faithfulness>, is exhibited. It is shown that it allows to formulate approximately the constraints in Bell-Kochen-Specker theorems such as to render the usual proofs robust. As a consequence, one can experimentally test to finite precision ontologically faithful non-contextuality, and thus experimentally refute explanations from this smaller class.

Here we reveal several merits of generalized SICs in connection with quantum state tomography and Lie algebra that are interesting in their own right. These properties uniquely characterize generalized SICs among minimal IC measurements although, on the face of it, they bear little resemblance to the original definition. In particular, we show that in quantum state tomography generalized SICs are optimal among minimal IC measurements with given average purity of measurement outcomes. Besides its significance to the current study, this result may help understand tomographic efficiencies of minimal IC measurements under the influence of noise. When minimal IC measurements are taken as bases for the Lie algebra of the unitary group, generalized SICs are uniquely characterized by the antisymmetry of the associated structure constants.},

Alice is given a string of length n, and Bob's task is to exclude certain combinations of bits that Alice might have. If Alice must send classical messages, then she must reveal nearly n bits of information to Bob, but if she is allowed to send quantum bits, the amount of information she must reveal goes to zero with increasing n. Next, we consider a version of the task where the parties can only send classical messages but may have access to entanglement. When assisted by entanglement, Alice only needs to send a constant number of bits, while without entanglement, the number of bits Alice must send grows linearly with n. The task is related to the PBR theorem which arises in the context of the foundations of quantum theory.},

  abstract = {We propose an iterative method for approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite dimensional output, possibly under additional constraints on the input distribution. Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an $\varepsilon$-close estimate to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires $O(\tfrac{(N \vee M) M^3 \log(N)^{1/2}}{\varepsilon})$, where $N$ denotes the input alphabet size and $M$ the output dimension. We then generalize the method for the task of approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded continuous input alphabet and a finite dimensional output. For channels with a finite dimensional quantum mechanical input and output, the idea of a universal encoder allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity using the same method. In particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can be reduced to a multidimensional integration problem. For families of quantum channels fulfilling a certain assumption we show that the complexity to derive an $\varepsilon$-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme in practice.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing promises a new approach to solving difficult computational problems, and the quest of building a quantum computer has started. While the first attempts on construction were succesful, scalability has never been achieved, due to the inherent fragile nature of the quantum bits (qubits). From the multitude of approaches to achieve scalability topological quantum computing (TQC) is the most promising one, by being based on an flexible approach to error-correction and making use of the straightforward measurement-based computing technique. TQC circuits are defined within a large, uniform, 3-dimensional lattice of physical qubits produced by the hardware and the physical volume of this lattice directly relates to the resources required for computation. Circuit optimization may result in non-intuitive mismatches between circuit specification and implementation. In this paper we introduce the first method for cross-level validation of TQC circuits. The specification of the circuit is expressed based on the stabilizer formalism, and the stabilizer table is checked by mapping the topology on the physical qubit level, followed by quantum circuit simulation. Simulation results show that cross-level validation of error-corrected circuits is feasible.},

But superquantum (or "PR-box") correlations imply that quantum mechanics is not the most nonlocal theory (in the sense of nonlocal correlations) consistent with relativistic causality. Let us consider supplementing these two axioms with a minimal third axiom: there exists a classical limit in which macroscopic observables commute. That is, just as quantum mechanics has a classical limit, so must any generalization of quantum mechanics. In this classical limit, PR-box correlations violate relativistic causality.

  abstract = {Adiabatic quantum optimization is a procedure to solve a vast class of optimization problems by slowly changing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system. The evolution time necessary for the algorithm to be successful scales inversely with the minimum energy gap encountered during the dynamics. Unfortunately, the direct calculation of the gap is strongly limited by the exponential growth in dimensionality of quantum systems. Although many special-purpose methods have been devised to reduce the effective dimensionality of the Hilbert space, they are strongly limited to particular classes of problems with evident symmetries. Here, we propose and implement a reduction method that does not rely on any explicit symmetry and which requires, under certain but quite general conditions, only a polynomial amount of classical resources. As a concrete example, we analyze the well known Grover problem in presence of local disorder. In particular we show that adiabatic quantum optimization, even when affected by random noise, is still potentially faster than any classical algorithm.},

It states that, if a collection of subspace constraints are "weakly dependent", there necessarily exists a state satisfying all constraints. It implies e.g. that certain instances of the kQSAT quantum satisfiability problem are necessarily satisfiable, or that many-body systems with "not too many" interactions are always frustration-free. However, the QLLL only asserts existence; it says nothing about how to find the state. Inspired by Moser's breakthrough classical results, we present a constructive version of the QLLL in the setting of commuting constraints, proving that a simple quantum algorithm converges efficiently to the required state. In fact, we provide two different proofs, one using a novel quantum coupling argument, the other a more explicit combinatorial analysis. Both proofs are independent of the QLLL. So these results also provide independent, constructive proofs of the commutative QLLL itself, but strengthen it significantly by giving an efficient algorithm for finding the state whose existence is asserted by the QLLL. We give an application of the constructive commutative QLLL to convergence of CP maps. We also extend these results to the non-commutative setting. However, our proof of the general constructive QLLL relies on a conjecture which we are only able to prove in special cases.},

  abstract = {The quantum Fourier transform (QFT), a quantum analog of the classical Fourier transform, has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum algorithms. However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete, quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum Haar and quantum Daubechies $D^{(4)}$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly. However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the quantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits that implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum circuits for the quantum wavelet transform.},

Compressive sensing, a procedure for solving inverse problems by incorporating prior knowledge about the form of the solution, provides an attractive alternative to the problem of high-dimensional quantum state characterisation. Using a modified version of compressive sensing that incorporates the principles of singular value thresholding, we reconstruct the density matrix of a high-dimensional two-photon entangled system. The dimension of each photon is equal to $d= 17$, corresponding to a system of 83521 unknown real parameters. Accurate reconstruction is achieved with approximately 2500 measurements, only 3\% of the total number of unknown parameters in the state. The algorithm we develop is fast, computationally inexpensive, and applicable to a wide range of quantum states, thus demonstrating compressive sensing as an effective technique for measuring the state of large-scale quantum systems.},

Here, we present a compact and autonomous QKD system that is capable of distributing provably-secure cryptographic key over 307 km of ultra-low-loss optical fibre (51.9 dB loss). The system is based on a recently developed standard semiconductor (inGaAs) SPDs with record low background noise and a novel efficient finite-key security analysis for QKD.

Here we show that, even in the presence of noise, probabilistic measurement strategies (which have a certain probability of failure or abstention) can provide, upon a heralded successful outcome, estimates with a precision that violates the deterministic bounds. This establishes a new ultimate quantum metrology limit.

  abstract = {The superposition principle is at the heart of quantum mechanics and at the root of many paradoxes arising when trying to extend its predictions to our everyday world. Schroedinger's cat is the prototype of such paradoxes and here, in contrast to many others, we choose to investigate it from the operational point of view. We experimentally demonstrate a universal strategy for producing an unambiguously distinguishable type of superposition, that of an arbitrary pure state and its orthogonal. It relies on only a limited amount of information about the input state to first generate its orthogonal one. Then, a simple change in the experimental parameters is used to produce arbitrary superpositions of the mutually orthogonal states. Constituting a sort of Schroedinger's black box, able to turn a whole zoo of input states into coherent superpositions, our scheme can produce arbitrary continuous-variable optical qubits, which may prove practical for implementing quantum technologies and measurement tasks.},

  abstract = {Quantum metrology enhances the sensitivity of parameter estimation using the distinctive resources of quantum mechanics such as entanglement. It has been shown that the precision of estimating an overall multiplicative factor of a Hamiltonian can be increased to exceed the classical limit, yet little is known about estimating a general Hamiltonian parameter. In this paper, we study this problem in detail. We find that the scaling of the estimation precision with the number of systems can always be optimized to the Heisenberg limit, while the time scaling can be quite different from that of estimating an overall multiplicative factor. We derive the generator of local parameter translation on the unitary evolution operator of the Hamiltonian, and use it to evaluate the estimation precision of the parameter and establish a general upper bound on the quantum Fisher information. The results indicate that the quantum Fisher information generally can be divided into two parts: one is quadratic in time, while the other oscillates with time. When the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian do not depend on the parameter, the quadratic term vanishes, and the quantum Fisher information will be bounded in this case. To illustrate the results, we give an example of estimating a parameter of a magnetic field by measuring a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle, and compare the results for estimating the amplitude and the direction of the magnetic field.},

Here we show how state-of-the-art superconducting technology allows us to simulate these phenomena in relatively small circuit lattices. By exploiting the strong non-linear couplings between quantized excitations emerging when superconducting qubits are coupled, we show how to engineer gauge invariant Hamiltonians, including ring-exchange and four-body Ising interactions. We demonstrate that, despite decoherence and disorder effects, minimal circuit instances allow us to investigate properties such as the dynamics of electric flux strings, signaling confinement in gauge invariant field theories. The experimental realization of these models in larger superconducting circuits could address open questions beyond current computational capability.},

This approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size $t^{-1/2}$ in the parameter space, and provides an explicit expression of the asymptotic quantum Fisher information in terms of the Markov generator. Furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the corresponding classical Fisher informations.

Mochon [Phys.Rev.A73,032328,(2006)], we formulate the problem of minimum error discrimination of an ensemble of n linearly independent pure states by embedding the optimal conditions in a matrix equation and matrix inequality. This isolates the rotationally invariant aspect of the problem from the rotationally covariant part of it. Employing the implicit function theorem in the matrix equation we get a set of first-order coupled ordinary non-linear differential equations which can be used to drag the solution from an initial point (where solution is known) to another point (whose solution is sought). This can be done through a simple taylor series expansion and analytic continuation when required. Thus, we complete the work done by Belavkin and C. Mochon by ultimately leading their theory to a solution for the MED problem of LI pure state ensembles. We also compare the computational complexity of this technique with a barrier-type interior point method of SDP and show that our technique is computationally less expensive than the SDP algorithm, with the added advantage of being simpler to implement.},

  abstract = {Non-contextuality (NC) and Bell inequalities can be expressed as bounds $\Omega$ for positive linear combinations $S$ of probabilities of events, $S \leq \Omega$. Exclusive events in $S$ can be represented as adjacent vertices of a graph called the exclusivity graph of $S$. In the case that events correspond to the outcomes of quantum projective measurements, quantum probabilities are intimately related to the Gr\"otschel-Lov\'asz-Schrijver theta body of the exclusivity graph. Then, one can easily compute an upper bound to the maximum quantum violation of any NC or Bell inequality by optimizing $S$ over the theta body and calculating the Lov\'asz number of the corresponding exclusivity graph. In some cases, this upper bound is tight and gives the exact maximum quantum violation. However, in general, this is not the case. The reason is that the exclusivity graph does not distinguish among the different ways exclusivity can occur in Bell-inequality (and similar) scenarios. An interesting question is whether there is a graph-theoretical concept which accounts for this problem. Here we show that, for any given $N$-partite Bell inequality, an edge-coloured multigraph composed of $N$ single-colour graphs can be used to encode the relationships of exclusivity between each party's parts of the events. Then, the maximum quantum violation of the Bell inequality is exactly given by a refinement of the Lov\'asz number that applies to these edge-coloured multigraphs. We show how to calculate upper bounds for this number using a hierarchy of semi-definite programs and calculate upper bounds for $I_3$, $I_{3322}$ and the three bipartite Bell inequalities whose exclusivity graph is a pentagon. The multigraph-theoretical approach introduced here may remove some obstacles in the program of explaining quantum correlations from first principles.},

In particular, we explore the effect of representing the gauge degrees of freedom with finite-dimensional systems and show that the results converge rapidly; thus even with small dimensions it is possible to obtain a reasonable accuracy. We also discuss the time scales required for the adiabatic preparation of the interacting vacuum state and observe that for a suitable ramping of the interaction the required time is almost insensitive to the system size and the dimension of the physical systems. Finally, we address the possible presence of noninvariant terms in the Hamiltonian that is realized in the experiment and show that for low levels of noise it is still possible to achieve a good precision for some ground-state observables, even if the gauge symmetry is not exact in the implemented model.},

In this paper we further investigate the lead--lag effect in financial markets, this time treating them as causal effects. To incorporate causality in a manner consistent with our previous study, that is including non-linear interdependencies, we base this study on a generalisation of Granger causality in the form of transfer entropy, or equivalently a special case of conditional (partial) mutual information. This way we are able to produce networks of stocks, where directed links represent causal relationships for a specific time lag. We apply this procedure to stocks belonging to the NYSE 100 index for various time lags, to investigate the short-term causality on this market, and to comment on the resulting Bonferroni networks.},

  abstract = {Photonic devices involving many optical modes promise major advances in quantum technologies, with applications ranging from quantum metrology over quantum computing to quantum simulations. A significant current roadblock for the development of such devices, however, is the lack of practical reliable certification tools. Here, we present one such tool. We start by carefully defining different notions of quantum-state certification tests. Then, we introduce an experimentally friendly, yet mathematically rigorous, certification test for experimental preparations of arbitrary m-mode pure Gaussian states as well as a class of pure non-Gaussian states common in linear-optical experiments, including those given by a Gaussian unitary acting on Fock basis states with n bosons. The protocol is efficient for all Gaussian states and all mentioned non-Gaussian states with constant n. We follow the formal mindset of an untrusted prover, who prepares the state, and a skeptic certifier, equipped only with classical computing and single-mode measurement capabilities. No assumptions are made on the type of quantum noise or experimental capabilities of the prover. We build upon an extremality property that leads to a practical fidelity lower bound, interesting in its own right. Experimentally, our technique relies on single-mode homodyne detection. With this method, the efficient and reliable certification of large-scale photonic networks, with a constant number of input photons, as those used for photonic quantum simulations, boson samplers, and quantum metrology is within reach.},

We consider the problem of learning the class of $n$-bit parity functions by making queries to a quantum example oracle. In the absence of noise, quantum and classical parity learning are easy and almost equally powerful, both information-theoretically and computationally. We show that in the presence of noise this story changes dramatically. Indeed, the classical learning problem is believed to be intractable, while the quantum version remains efficient. Depolarizing the qubits at the oracle's output at any constant nonzero rate does not increase the computational (or query) complexity of quantum learning more than logarithmically. However, the problem of learning from corresponding classical examples is the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, for which the best known algorithms have superpolynomial complexity. This creates the possibility of observing a quantum advantage with a few hundred noisy qubits. The presence of noise is essential for creating this quantum-classical separation.},

  abstract = {A novel type of a quantum random number generator is presented that features characteristics necessary for application in a loophole-free Bell inequality test: (1) a very short latency between the request for a random bit and moment when the bit is generated of (9.8 \pm 0.2) ns; (2) all physical processes relevant to a generation of a bit happen after the bit request signal; (3) high efficiency of producing a bit upon a request (100\% by design). Additionally, the generator is characterized by: ability of high bit generation rate, possibility to use a low-efficiency photon detector, a high ratio of number of bits per detected photon (\approx 2) and simplicity of design. Generated sequences of random bits pass NIST Statistical Test Suite without postprocessing. The generator can be also used for any other purpose where random numbers are needed.},

  abstract = {The problem of discriminating the state of a quantum system among a number of hypothetical states is usually addressed under the assumption that one has perfect knowledge of the possible states of the system. In this thesis, I analyze the role of the prior information available in facing such problems, and consider scenarios where the information regarding the possible states is incomplete. In front of a complete ignorance of the possible states' identity, I discuss a quantum "programmable" discrimination machine for qubit states that accepts this information as input programs using a quantum encoding, rather than as a classical description. The optimal performance of these machines is studied for general qubit states when several copies are provided, in the schemes of unambiguous, minimum-error, and error-margin discrimination. Then, this type of automation in discrimination tasks is taken further. By realizing a programmable machine as a device that is trained through quantum information to perform a specific task, I propose a quantum "learning" machine for classifying qubit states that does not require a quantum memory to store the qubit programs and, nevertheless, performs as good as quantum mechanics permits. Such learning machine thus allows for several optimal uses with no need for retraining. A similar learning scheme is also discussed for coherent states of light. I present it in the context of the readout of a classical memory by means of classically correlated coherent signals, when these are produced by an imperfect source. I show that, in this case, the retrieval of information stored in the memory can be carried out more accurately when fully general quantum measurements are used. Finally, as a transversal topic, I propose an efficient algorithmic way of decomposing any quantum measurement into convex combinations of simpler (extremal) measurements.},

  abstract = {Quantum technology promises revolutionary advantages in information processing and transmission compared to classical technology; however, determining which specific resources are needed to surpass the capabilities of classical machines often remains a nontrivial problem. To address such a problem, one first needs to establish the best classical solutions, which set benchmarks that must be beaten by any implementation claiming to harness quantum features for an enhanced performance. Here we introduce and develop a self-contained formalism to obtain the ultimate, generally probabilistic benchmarks for quantum information protocols including teleportation and approximate cloning, with arbitrary ensembles of input states generated by a group action, so-called Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states. This allows us to construct explicit fidelity thresholds for the transmission of multimode Gaussian and non-Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, as well as qubit and qudit pure states drawn according to nonuniform distributions on the Bloch hypersphere, which accurately model the current laboratory facilities. The performance of deterministic classical procedures such as square-root measurement strategies is further compared with the optimal probabilistic benchmarks, and the state-of-the-art performance of experimental quantum implementations against our newly derived thresholds is discussed. This work provides a comprehensive collection of directly useful criteria for the reliable certification of quantum communication technologies.},

As the state evolves from an initial product state, it gets asymptotically maximally entangled. We define irreversibility as the failure of searching for a disentangling circuit using a Metropolis-like algorithm. We show that irreversibility corresponds to Wigner-Dyson statistics in the level spacing of the entanglement eigenvalues, and that this is obtained from a quantum circuit made from a set of universal gates for quantum computation. If, on the other hand, the system is evolved with a non-universal set of gates, the statistics of the entanglement level spacing deviates from Wigner-Dyson and the disentangling algorithm succeeds. These results open a new way to characterize irreversibility in quantum systems.},

However, in practical implementations, it suffers from quantum hacking due to device imperfections. Here we propose a hybrid measurement attack, with only linear optics, homodyne detection, and single photon detection, to the widely used vacuum+weak decoy state QKD system when the phase of source is partially randomized. Our analysis shows that, in some parameter regimes, the proposed attack would result in an entanglement breaking channel but still be able to trick the legitimate users to believe they have transmitted secure keys. That is, the eavesdropper is able to steal all the key information without discovered by the users. Thus, our proposal reveals that partial phase randomization is not sufficient to guarantee the security of phase-encoding QKD systems with weak coherent states.},

Relative to such a set, we define a "MUB-balanced state" to be a pure state for which the list of probabilities of the $d$ outcomes of one of these measurements is independent of the choice of measurement, up to permutations. In this paper we explicitly construct a MUB-balanced state for each prime power dimension $d$ for which $d = 3$ (mod 4). These states have already been constructed by Appleby in unpublished notes, but our presentation here is different in that both the expression for the states themselves and the proof of MUB-balancedness are given in terms of the discrete Wigner function, rather than the density matrix or state vector. The discrete Wigner functions of these states are "rotationally symmetric" in a sense roughly analogous to the rotational symmetry of the energy eigenstates of a harmonic oscillator in the continuous two-dimensional phase space. Upon converting the Wigner function to a density matrix, we find that the states are expressible as real state vectors in the standard basis. We observe numerically that when $d$ is large (and not a power of 3), a histogram of the components of such a state vector appears to form a semicircular distribution.},

We show that with a proper choice of the onsite basis, the degenerate ground-state space of SPT orders (on a manifold with boundary) is a quantum error-correcting code with macroscopic classical distance, hence is stable against any local bit-flip errors. We show that this error-correcting property of the SPT orders has a natural connection to that of the symmetry-breaking orders, whose degenerate ground-state space is a classical error-correcting code with a macroscopic distance, providing a new angle for the hidden symmetry-breaking properties in SPT orders. We propose new types of topological entanglement entropy that probe the STP orders hidden in their symmetric ground states, which also signal the topological phase transitions protected by symmetry. Combined with the original definition of topological entanglement entropy that probes the 'intrinsic topological orders', and the recent proposed one that probes the symmetry-breaking orders, the set of different types of topological entanglement entropy may hence distinguish topological orders, SPT orders, and symmetry-breaking orders, which may be mixed up in a single system.},

  abstract = {The wave-particle duality dates back to Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect through quanta of light and de Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves. Quantum mechanics uses an abstract description for the behavior of physical systems such as photons, electrons, or atoms. Whether quantum predictions for single systems in an interferometric experiment allow an intuitive understanding in terms of the particle or wave picture, depends on the specific configuration which is being used. In principle, this leaves open the possibility that quantum systems always either behave definitely as a particle or definitely as a wave in every experimental run by a priori adapting to the specific experimental situation. This is precisely what is tried to be excluded by delayed-choice experiments, in which the observer chooses to reveal the particle or wave character -- or even a continuous transformation between the two -- of a quantum system at a late stage of the experiment. We review the history of delayed-choice gedanken experiments, which can be traced back to the early days of quantum mechanics. Then we discuss their experimental realizations, in particular Wheeler's delayed choice in interferometric setups as well as delayed-choice quantum erasure and entanglement swapping. The latter is particularly interesting, because it elevates the wave-particle duality of a single quantum system to an entanglement-separability duality of multiple systems.},

We describe a conceptual framework to study these questions, using a connection proved by the author in [19] between the set of nonidentity generalized Pauli operators on the Hilbert space of $N$ $d$-level quantum systems, $d$ a prime, and the geometry of non-degenerate alternating bilinear forms of rank $N$ over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_d$. We then supply alternative and short proofs of results obtained in [10], as well as new general bounds for the problems considered in loc. cit. In this setting, we also solve Conjecture 1 of [10], and speculate on variations of this conjecture.},

  abstract = {A scheme that successfully employs quantum mechanics in the design of autonomous learning agents has recently been reported in the context of the projective simulation (PS) model for artificial intelligence. In that approach, the key feature of a PS agent, a specific type of memory which is explored via random walks, was shown to be amenable to quantization. In particular, classical random walks were substituted by Szegedy-type quantum walks, allowing for a speed-up. In this work we propose how such classical and quantum agents can be implemented in systems of trapped ions. We employ a generic construction by which the classical agents are `upgraded' to their quantum counterparts by nested coherent controlization, and we outline how this construction can be realized in ion traps. Our results provide a flexible modular architecture for the design of PS agents. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations of simple PS agents which analyze the robustness of our proposal under certain noise models.},

  abstract = {For an anyon model in two spatial dimensions described by a modular tensor category, the topological S-matrix encodes the mutual braiding statistics, the quantum dimensions, and the fusion rules of anyons. It is nontrivial whether one can compute the S-matrix from a single ground state wave function. Here, we define a class of Hamiltonians consisting of local commuting projectors and an associated matrix that is invariant under local unitary transformations. We argue that the invariant is equivalent to the topological S-matrix. The definition does not require degeneracy of the ground state. We prove that the invariant depends on the state only, in the sense that it can be computed by any Hamiltonian in the class of which the state is a ground state. As a corollary, we prove that any local quantum circuit that connects two ground states of quantum double models (discrete gauge theories) with non-isomorphic abelian groups, must have depth that is at least linear in the system's diameter.},

Bell's insight that non-local correlations between quantum systems cannot be explained classically can be verified experimentally, and has numerous applications in modern quantum information. Today, the CHSH inequality is probably the most well-known Bell inequality and it has given us a wealth of understanding in what differentiates the classical from the quantum world. Yet, there are certainly other means of quantifying "Bell non-locality without inequalities" such as the famous Hardy's paradox. As such, one may wonder whether these are entirely different approaches to non-locality. For this anniversary issue, we unify the perspective of the CHSH inequality and Hardy Paradox into one family of non-local games which include both as special cases.},

  abstract = {The fact that not all measurements can be carried out simultaneously is a peculiar feature of quantum mechanics and responsible for many key phenomena in the theory, such as complementarity or uncertainty relations. For the special case of projective measurements quantum behavior can be characterized by the commutator but for generalized measurements it is not easy to decide whether two measurements can still be understood in classical terms or whether they show already quantum features. We prove that generalized measurements which do not fulfill the notion of joint measurability are nonclassical, as they can be used for the task of quantum steering. This shows that the notion of joint measurability is, among several definitions, the proper one to characterize quantum behavior. Moreover, the equivalence allows to derive novel steering inequalities from known results on joint measurability and new criteria for joint measurability from known results on the steerability of states.},

  abstract = {Quantum error-correcting codes are many-body entangled states that are prepared and measured using complex sequences of entangling operations. Each element of such an entangling sequence introduces noise to delicate quantum information during the encoding or reading out of the code. It is important therefore to find efficient entangling protocols to avoid the loss of information. Here we propose an experiment that uses only global entangling operations to encode an arbitrary logical qubit to either the five-qubit repetition code or the five-qubit code, with a six-ion Coulomb crystal architecture in a Penning trap. We show that the use of global operations enables us to prepare and read out these codes using only six and ten global entangling pulses, respectively. The proposed experiment also allows the acquisition of syndrome information during readout. We provide a noise analysis for the presented protocols, estimating that we can achieve a six-fold improvement in coherence time with noise as high as $\sim 1\%$ on each entangling operation.},

Numerical simulations of the quantum dynamics allow us to quantify the AQO recall accuracy with respect to the number of stored memories and the noise in the input key. We also investigate AQO performance with respect to how memories are stored in the Ising model using different learning rules. Our results indicate that AQO performance varies strongly with learning rule due to the changes in the energy landscape. Consequently, learning rules offer indirect methods for investigating change to the computational complexity of the recall task and the computational efficiency of AQO.},

In this work, we show how to classically simulate these circuits when the gate in question belongs to certain families of solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. These include all of the qubit (i.e., $d = 2$) solutions, and some simple families that include solutions for arbitrary $d \ge 2$.

This method was introduced in [1] in the context of quantum adiabatic computation, but we consider it more generally. Specifically, we consider a computational Hamiltonian, which has been encoded using the logical qubits of a single-qubit error detecting code, coupled to an environment of qubits by interaction terms that act one-locally on the system. Energy penalty terms are added that penalize states outside of the codespace. We prove that in the limit of infinitely large penalties, one-local errors are completely suppressed, and we derive some bounds for the finite penalty case. Our proof technique involves exact integration of the Schrodinger equation, making no use of master equations or their assumptions. We perform long time numerical simulations on a small (one logical qubit) computational system coupled to an environment and the results suggest that the energy penalty method achieves even greater protection than our bounds indicate.},

However, isn't is possible to realize a secure cloud quantum computing for a client who is completely free from any quantum technology?

  abstract = {The discovery of topological phases in condensed matter systems has changed the modern conception of phases of matter. The global nature of topological ordering makes these phases robust and hence promising for applications. However, the non-locality of this ordering makes direct experimental studies an outstanding challenge, even in the simplest model topological systems, and interactions among the constituent particles adds to this challenge. Here we demonstrate a novel dynamical method to explore topological phases in both interacting and non-interacting systems, by employing the exquisite control afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits. We utilize this method to experimentally explore the well-known Haldane model of topological phase transitions by directly measuring the topological invariants of the system. We construct the topological phase diagram of this model and visualize the microscopic evolution of states across the phase transition, tasks whose experimental realizations have remained elusive. Furthermore, we developed a new qubit architecture that allows simultaneous control over every term in a two-qubit Hamiltonian, with which we extend our studies to an interacting Hamiltonian and discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological phase. Our implementation, involving the measurement of both global and local textures of quantum systems, is close to the original idea of quantum simulation as envisioned by R. Feynman, where a controllable quantum system is used to investigate otherwise inaccessible quantum phenomena. This approach demonstrates the potential of superconducting qubits for quantum simulation and establishes a powerful platform for the study of topological phases in quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Nonlocal properties of an ensemble of diagonal random unitary matrices of order $N^2$ are investigated. The average Schmidt strength of such a bipartite diagonal quantum gate is shown to scale as $\log N$, in contrast to the $\log N^2$ behavior characteristic to random unitary gates. Entangling power of a diagonal gate $U$ is related to the von Neumann entropy of an auxiliary quantum state $\rho=AA^{\dagger}/N^2$, where the square matrix $A$ is obtained by reshaping the vector of diagonal elements of $U$ of length $N^2$ into a square matrix of order $N$. This fact provides a motivation to study the ensemble of non-hermitian unimodular matrices $A$, with all entries of the same modulus and random phases and the ensemble of quantum states $\rho$, such that all their diagonal entries are equal to $1/N$. Such a state is contradiagonal with respect to the computational basis, in sense that among all unitary equivalent states it maximizes the entropy copied to the environment due to the coarse graining process. The first four moments of the squared singular values of the unimodular ensemble are derived, based on which we conjecture a connection to a recently studied combinatorial object called the "Borel triangle". This allows us to find exactly the mean von Neumann entropy for random phase density matrices and the average entanglement for the corresponding ensemble of bipartite pure states.},

Using the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), we construct an associated gauging map for Hamiltonians and show how this results in a frustration free gauge theory Hamiltonian. This procedure reproduces the minimal coupling scheme for the matter terms and automatically generates gauge dynamics closely related to the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian at zero coupling constant. We can then introduce gauge dynamics at finite values of the coupling constant by applying a local filtering operation. The gauging procedure transforms an injective PEPS for the matter fields into a G-injective PEPS for the combined gauge-matter system, which potentially has topological order. This scheme results in a low-parameter family of gauge invariant states of which we can accurately probe the phase diagram, as we illustrate by studying a Z_2 gauge theory with Higgs matter.},

We first show how they question our knowledge on what a mixed quantum state is, as we identify situations in which ensembles of quantum states defining the same mixed state, indistinguishable according to the quantum postulates, do become distinguishable when prepared by a computer. We also show a new loophole for Bell-like experiments: if some of the parties in a Bell-like experiment use a computer to decide which measurements to make, then the computational resources of an eavesdropper have to be limited in order to have a proper observation of non-locality.

  abstract = {Bell inequalities are intended to show that local realist theories cannot describe the world. A local realist theory is one where physical properties are defined prior to and independent of measurement, and no physical influence can propagate faster than the speed of light. Quantum-mechanical predictions for certain experiments violate the Bell inequality while a local realist theory cannot, and this shows that a local realist theory cannot give those quantum-mechanical predictions. However, because of unexpected circumstances or "loopholes" in available experiment tests, local realist theories can reproduce the data from these experiments. This paper reviews such loopholes, what effect they have on Bell inequality tests, and how to avoid them in experiment. Avoiding all these simultaneously in one experiment, usually called a "loophole-free" or "definitive" Bell test, remains an open task, but is very important for technological tasks such as device-independent security of quantum cryptography, and ultimately for our understanding of the world.},

In the second part we investigate how successful the algorithm can be if the number of elements of the database is not known precisely. This question reduces to analysis of the distinguishability of states occurring during Grover's algorithm.

Extensive efforts have always been taken to completely shield these circuits from external magnetic field to protect the integrity of superconductivity.

Using a contactless injection technique with unprecedented dynamic range, we quantitatively distinguish between recombination and trapping mechanisms in controlling the dynamics of residual quasiparticles, and show quantized changes in quasiparticle trapping rate due to individual vortices. These results highlight the prominent role of quasiparticle trapping in future development of superconducting qubits, and provide a powerful characterization tool along the way.},

An input state comprising vacuum and single photon states is fed through a Haar-random linear optics network and sampled at the output using coincidence photodetection. This problem is strongly believed to be classically hard to simulate. We show that an analogous procedure implements the same problem, using photon-added or -subtracted squeezed vacuum states (with arbitrary squeezing), where sampling at the output is performed via parity measurements. The equivalence is exact and independent of the squeezing parameter, and hence provides an entire class of new quantum states of light in the same complexity class as boson sampling.},

  abstract = {Self-testing refers to the fact that, in some quantum devices, both states and measurements can be assessed in a black-box scenario, on the sole basis of the observed statistics, i.e. without reference to any prior device calibration. Only a few examples of self-testing are known, and they just provide non-trivial assessment for devices performing unrealistically close to the ideal case. We overcome these difficulties by approaching self-testing with the semi-definite programming hierarchy for the characterization of quantum correlations. This allows us to improve dramatically the robustness of previous self-testing schemes -e.g.: we show that a CHSH violation larger than 2.57 certifies a singlet fidelity of more than 70%. In addition, the versatility of the tool brings about self-testing of hitherto impossible cases, such as robust self-testing of non-maximally entangled two-qutrit states in the CGLMP scenario.},

  abstract = {We derive one-shot upper bounds for quantum noisy channel codes. We do so by regarding a channel code as a bipartite operation with an encoder belonging to the sender and a decoder belonging to the receiver, and imposing constraints on the bipartite operation. We investigate the power of codes whose bipartite operation is non-signalling from Alice to Bob, positive-partial transpose (PPT) preserving, or both, and derive a simple semidefinite program for the achievable entanglement fidelity. Using the semidefinite program, we show that the non-signalling assisted quantum capacity for memoryless channels is equal to the entanglement-assisted capacity. We also relate our PPT-preserving codes and the PPT-preserving entanglement distillation protocols studied by Rains. Applying these results to a concrete example, the 3-dimensional Werner-Holevo channel, we find that codes that are non-signalling and PPT-preserving can be strictly less powerful than codes satisfying either one of the constraints, and therefore provide a tighter bound for unassisted codes. Furthermore, PPT-preserving non-signalling codes can send one qubit perfectly over two uses of the channel, which has no quantum capacity. We discuss whether this can be interpreted as a form of superactivation of quantum capacity.},

  abstract = {There exist diverse no-go theorems, ranging from no-cloning to monogamies of quantum correlations and Bell inequality violations, which restrict the processing of information in the quantum world. In a multipartite scenario, monogamy of Bell inequality violation and exclusion principle of dense coding are such theorems, which impede the ability of the system to have quantum advantage between all its parts. In ordered spin systems, the twin restrictions of translation invariance and monogamy of quantum correlations, in general, enforce the bipartite states to be neither Bell inequality violating nor dense-codeable. We show that these quantum characteristics, viz. Bell inequality violation and dense-codeability, can be resurrected, and thereby the no-go theorems overcome, by having quenched disorder in the system parameters leading to quantum spin glass or quantum random field models. We show that the quantum characteristics are regained even though the quenched averaging keeps the disordered spin chains translationally invariant at the physically relevant level of observables. The results show that it is possible to conquer constraints imposed by quantum mechanics in ordered systems by introducing impurities.},

  abstract = {The existence of observables that are incompatible or not jointly measurable is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics, which is the root of a number of nonclassical phenomena, such as uncertainty relations, wave--particle dual behavior, Bell-inequality violation, and contextuality. However, no intuitive criterion is available for determining the compatibility of even two (generalized) observables, despite the overarching importance of this problem and intensive efforts of many researchers over more than 80 years. Here we introduce an information theoretic paradigm together with an intuitive geometric picture for decoding incompatible observables, starting from two simple ideas: Every observable can only provide limited information and information is monotonic under data processing. By virtue of quantum estimation theory, we introduce a family of universal criteria for detecting incompatible observables and a natural measure of incompatibility, which are applicable to arbitrary number of arbitrary observables. Based on this framework, we derive a family of universal measurement uncertainty relations, provide a simple information theoretic explanation of quantitative wave--particle duality, and offer new perspectives for understanding Bell nonlocality, contextuality, and quantum precision limit.},

Here we establish a computational quantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a quantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider the commuting quantum circuits as dynamics of the quantum system. To show intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the postselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J. Shepherd [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Science 465, 1413 (2009).] and crucially strengthen its statement by taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability below the boundary is shown by taking a projected-entangled-pair-state picture. Not only the separability criteria but also the condition for the entangled pair to become a convex mixture of stabilizer states is developed to show classical simulatability of highly entangling operations. We found that when each qubit is subject to a single-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational quantum-classical boundary is tightly given by the dephasing rate required for the magic state distillation.},

  abstract = {One way quantum computing uses single qubit projective measurements performed on a cluster state (a highly entangled state of multiple qubits) in order to enact quantum gates. The model is promising due to its potential scalability; the cluster state may be produced at the beginning of the computation and operated on over time. Continuous variables (CV) offer another potential benefit in the form of deterministic entanglement generation. This determinism can lead to robust cluster states and scalable quantum computation. Recent demonstrations of CV cluster states have made great strides on the path to scalability utilizing either time or frequency multiplexing in optical parametric oscillators (OPO) both above and below threshold. The techniques relied on a combination of entangling operators and beam splitter transformations. Here we show that an analogous transformation exists for amplifiers with Gaussian inputs states operating on multiple spatial modes. By judicious selection of local oscillators (LOs), the spatial mode distribution is analogous to the optical frequency comb consisting of axial modes in an OPO cavity. We outline an experimental system that generates cluster states across the spatial frequency comb which can also scale the amount of quantum noise reduction to potentially larger than in other systems.},

In the case of general linear groups over a finite field $F_q$, given a sequence of positive integers $n_1, ..., n_k$, where $n=n_1+...+n_k$, a parabolic subgroup of parameter $(n_1, ..., n_k)$ in $GL_n(F_q)$ is a conjugate of the subgroup consisting of block lower triangular matrices where the $i$th block is of size $n_i$.

  abstract = {Current approaches for building quantum computing devices focus on two-level quantum systems which nicely mimic the concept of a classical bit, albeit enhanced with additional quantum properties. However, rather than artificially limiting the number of states to two, the use of d-level quantum systems (qudits) could provide advantages for quantum information processing. Among other merits, it has recently been shown that multi-level quantum systems can offer increased stability to external disturbances - a key problem in current technologies. In this study we demonstrate that topological quantum memories built from qudits, also known as abelian quantum double models, exhibit a substantially increased resilience to noise. That is, even when taking into account the multitude of errors possible for multi-level quantum systems, topological quantum error correction codes employing qudits can sustain a larger error rate than their two-level counterparts. In particular, we find strong numerical evidence that the thresholds of these error-correction codes are given by the hashing bound. Considering the significantly increased error thresholds attained, this might well outweigh the added complexity of engineering and controlling higher dimensional quantum systems.},

While non-Markovianity of a quantum dynamics has been defined looking at the behaviour in time of the statistical operator, which determines the evolution of mean values, the quantum regression theorem makes statements about the behaviour of system correlation functions of order two and higher. The comparison relies on an estimate of the validity of the quantum regression hypothesis, which can be obtained exactly evaluating two points correlation functions. To this aim we consider a qubit undergoing dephasing due to interaction with a bosonic bath, comparing the exact evaluation of the non-Markovianity measures with the violation of the quantum regression theorem for a class of spectral densities. We further study a photonic dephasing model, recently exploited for the experimental measurement of non-Markovianity. It appears that while a non-Markovian dynamics according to either definition brings with itself violation of the regression hypothesis, even Markovian dynamics can lead to a failure of the regression relation.},

  abstract = {Fault-tolerant Z rotations by pi/2^k are important as they arise in numerous quantum algorithms, most notably those involving quantum Fourier transforms. We describe surface code implementations of two recently described methods of efficiently constructing these rotations. One method uses state distillation to get low-error (|0> + exp(i pi/2^k)|1>)/sqrt(2) states, with each distillation level requiring 2^(k+2)-1 input states to produce a single purer output state, and uses these distilled states to directly implement pi/2^k angle Z rotations. The other method is indirect, using sequences of single-qubit Clifford and T gates. We compute and compare the overhead of our surface code implementations of these two techniques. We find that the approximating sequence overhead is less than or equal to direct distillation for k > 3 and logical error rates <~ 10^-12.},

  abstract = {Individual impurity atoms in silicon can make superb individual qubits, but it remains an immense challenge to build a multi-qubit processor: There is a basic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit interactions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and addressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one another. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.},

  abstract = {The problem of using observed correlations to infer causal relations is relevant to a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Yet given correlations between just two classical variables, it is impossible to determine whether they arose from a causal influence of one on the other or a common cause influencing both, unless one can implement a randomized intervention. We here consider the problem of causal inference for quantum variables. We introduce causal tomography, which unifies and generalizes conventional quantum tomography schemes to provide a complete solution to the causal inference problem using a quantum analogue of a randomized trial. We furthermore show that, in contrast to the classical case, observed quantum correlations alone can sometimes provide a solution. We implement a quantum-optical experiment that allows us to control the causal relation between two optical modes, and two measurement schemes -- one with and one without randomization -- that extract this relation from the observed correlations. Our results show that entanglement and coherence, known to be central to quantum information processing, also provide a quantum advantage for causal inference.},

  abstract = {The simulation of molecules is a widely anticipated application of quantum computers. However, recent studies \cite{WBCH13a,HWBT14a} have cast a shadow on this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations increases with the number of spin orbitals $N$ as $N^8$, which becomes prohibitive even for molecules of modest size $N\sim 100$. This study was partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead that the scaling is closer to $N^6$ in worst case for real model molecules we have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the coalescing scheme of \cite{WBCH13a}; this scheme is based on using different Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of \cite{WBCH13a,HWBT14a} which relied on exponentially costly classical exact simulation.},

We show that the latter becomes a sensible security criterion if an upper bound on the coherence time of the eavesdropper's quantum memory is known. Under this condition we introduce a protocol for secret key generation through a memoryless qudit channel. For channels with enough symmetry, such as the d-dimensional erasure and depolarizing channels, this protocol allows secret key generation at an asymptotic rate as high as the classical capacity minus one bit.},

In the absence of a phase reference, we highlight how specific higher order correlation functions can still be predicted. We exemplify the functioning of the approach by reconstructing randomised continuous matrix product states from their correlation data and study the robustness of the reconstruction for different noise models. We also apply the method to data generated by simulations based on continuous matrix product states and using the time-dependent variational principle. The presented approach is expected to open up a new window into experimentally studying continuous quantum systems, such as encountered in experiments with ultra-cold atoms on top of atom chips.

  abstract = {The current operational formulation of quantum theory is based on the concept of operation with an input and an output system, which assumes a prior notion of time and is asymmetric under time reversal. But in certain contexts, such as those involving gravity, time is expected to be dynamical and not predefined. Here, we propose an operational formulation of quantum theory without any predefined notion of time. It is based on a generalization of the concept of operation motivated by an epistemic approach: an operation is a description of knowledge about the events in a given region, which can be updated conditionally on information obtained from that region. Each such region has a set of boundary systems, which by definition provide the sole means of information exchange between the events in the region and the events in other regions. Separate operations can be connected in networks through their boundary systems with no directionality assumed for the connections, which generalizes the standard circuit picture. The events associated with an operation are described by positive semidefinite operators on the Hilbert spaces of the boundary systems, while the connections between regions are described by entangled states that encode a nontrivial physical symmetry. A simple rule provides the joint probabilities for the events in a network of operations. We discuss how it may be possible to understand the emergence of a causal structure from properties of the operators on the boundaries of compact space-time regions. The framework allows for indefinite causal order, timelike loops, and other acausal structures. As part of this work, we obtain a generalization of Wigner's theorem, which is based on the preservation of probabilities of actual events and thus puts the concept of time reversal symmetry on operational grounds. It contains the possibility for a new class of symmetry transformations.},

  abstract = {Generally, the local interactions in a many-body quantum spin system on a lattice do not commute with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a local region will generally not commute with that of the entire system, and so the two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between the probability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global Hamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these two Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two distributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an energy $\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of eigenstates with energies $\epsilon<\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the probability of measuring a global energy $\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that is in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems. Very roughly, we show that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these distributions are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to some exponentially small corrections. Finally, we use these bounds to study the spectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the energies of a contiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\tau$. We show that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially close to that of the original Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result in 1D was a central building block in a recent improvement of the 1D area-law.},

But even if the actual system is treated quantum mechanically, the field is assumed to be classical and of infinite strength, hence not developing any correlations with the system or experiencing back-actions. We extend these considerations to a fully quantum mechanical treatment, by studying a spin-1/2 particle coupled to a finite-sized directional quantum reference frame, a spin-l system, which models an external field. With this concrete model together with a bosonic thermal bath, we analyse the back-action a finite-size field suffers during a quantum-mechanical work extraction process, the effect this has on the extractable work, and highlight a range of assumptions commonly made when considering such processes. The well-known semi-classical treatment of work extraction from a pure qubit predicts a maximum extractable work W = kT log 2 for a quasi-static process, which holds as a strict upper bound in the fully quantum mechanical case, and is only attained in the classical limit. We also address the problem of emergent local time-dependence in a joint system with globally fixed Hamiltonian.},

In particular, the algorithm that we consider determines whether eight permutation functions defined on a set of four elements is positive or negative cyclic. While any classical solution to this problem requires two evaluations of the function, quantum mechanics allows us to perform the same task with only a single evaluation. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of the considered quantum algorithm with a quadrupolar nuclear magnetic resonance setup using a single four-level quantum system, i.e., a ququart.},

  abstract = {In this brief note, we compare two frameworks for characterizing possible operations in quantum thermodynamics. One framework considers Thermal Operations---unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal Operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true---Gibbs-Preserving Maps are no more powerful than Thermal Operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-Preserving Map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while Thermal Operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics.},

We demonstrate that the reconfigurability of our design allows us to overcome two major impediments to quantum optics on a chip: it removes the need for a full fabrication cycle for each experiment and allows for compensation of fabrication errors using numerical optimization techniques. Under a pessimistic fabrication model for the silicon-on-insulator process, we demonstrate a dramatic fidelity improvement for the linear optics CNOT and CPHASE gates and, showing the scalability of this approach, the iterative phase estimation algorithm built from individually optimized gates. We also propose and simulate a novel experiment that the programmability of our system would enable: a statistically robust study of the evolution of entangled photons in disordered quantum walks. Overall, our results suggest that existing fabrication processes are sufficient to build a quantum photonic processor capable of high fidelity operation.},

  abstract = {Contextuality is a central property in comparative analysis of classical, quantum, and supercorrelated systems. We examine and compare two well-motivated approaches to contextuality by applying each of them to two important cases where contextuality appears in physics: the Leggett-Garg and the EPR-Bell systems. One approach ("contextuality-by-default") is based on the idea that one and the same physical property measured under different conditions (contexts) is represented by different random variables: the contextuality in a system is measured by minimizing the probabilities with which random variables representing one and the same physical property in different contexts can attain unequal values in a joint distribution imposed on all the random variables by which the system is described. The other approach is based on the idea that while a physical property is represented by a single random variable irrespective of its measurement conditions, the joint distributions of the random variables describing the system can involve negative (quasi-)probabilities: the contextuality is measured by minimizing the sum of all the negative probabilities required. We show that in the simplest Leggett-Garg and EPR-Bell systems the two measures essentially coincide, although for more complex systems they may not determine each other uniquely.},

This explains the previous result that lack of third-order interference (along with the condition that several independent copies of any realisable behaviour should again be realisable) rules out the existence of the Popescu-Rorlich box and the Wright pentagon, and implies new results such as bounds on violations of the CHSH inequality, and lack of quantum advantage in the Guess Your Neighbour's Input game.},

First, we introduce a compression method in which the bond dimension scales as $D=e^{O(\log^2(N/\epsilon))}$ if $\beta<O(\log (N))$. Second, building on the work of Hastings [Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)], we derive a polynomial scaling relation, $D=\left(N/\epsilon\right)^{O(\beta)}$. This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows that ground states can be approximated with $D=N^{O(\log(N))}$ whenever the density of states only grows polynomially in the system size. All results hold for any spatial dimension of the lattice.},

This remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing on the transmitted quantum data. Our result has several applications. Most importantly, for generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum communication over such channels. This for the first time conclusively settles the strong converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial quantum capacity.

We develop protocols that enable universal quantum computing by adiabatic evolution in a way that keeps the energy gap of the system constant with respect to the computation size and introduces only simple local Hamiltonian interactions.

  abstract = {Superconducting qubits, while promising for scalability and long coherence times, contain more than two energy levels, and therefore are susceptible to errors generated by the leakage of population outside of the computational subspace. Such leakage errors preclude the existing quantum error-correcting schemes from protecting the encoded quantum information, and therefore, are considered to be a prominent roadblock towards Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) with superconducting qubits. FTQC using topological codes is based on sequential measurements of multi-qubit stabilizer operators. Here, we first propose a leakage-resilient procedure to perform repetitive measurements of multi-qubit stabilizer operators, and then use this scheme as an ingredient to develop a leakage-resilient approach for surface code quantum error correction with superconducting circuits. Our protocol is based on SWAP operations between data and ancilla qubits at the end of every cycle, requiring read-out and reset operations on every physical qubit in the system, and thereby preventing persistent leakage errors from occurring.},

  abstract = {Over the past three decades, quantum mechanics has allowed the development of technologies that provide unconditionally secure communication. In parallel, the quantum nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has spawned the field of quantum imaging that encompasses technologies such as quantum ghost imaging and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The emergence of such quantum technologies also highlights the need for the development of methods for characterizing the elusive quantum state itself. In this document, we describe new technologies that use the quantum properties of light for security. The first is a technique that extends the principles behind QKD to the field of imaging. By applying the polarization-based BB84 protocol to individual photons in an active imaging system, we obtained images that are secure against intercept-resend jamming attacks. The second technology presented in this article is based on an extension of quantum ghost imaging. We used a holographic filtering technique to build a quantum ghost image identification system that uses a few pairs of photons to identify an object from a set of known objects. The third technology addressed in this document is a high-dimensional QKD system that uses orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes of light for encoding. Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one to impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels of security. We discuss the development of two OAM-QKD protocols based on the BB84 and Ekert QKD protocols. The fourth and final technology presented in this article is a relatively new technique called direct measurement that uses sequential weak and strong measurements to characterize a quantum state. We use this technique to characterize the quantum state of a photon with a dimensionality of d=27, and measure its rotation in the natural basis of OAM.},

These norms (introduced by Matthews, Wehner and Winter) quantify how quantum measurements, subject to locality constraints, perform in the task of discriminating two multipartite quantum states. We mainly address the following question regarding the behaviour of these distinguishability norms in the high-dimensional regime: On a bipartite space, what are the relative strengths of standard classes of locally restricted measurements? We show that the class of PPT measurements typically performs almost as well as the class of all measurements whereas restricting to local measurements and classical communication, or even just to separable measurements, implies a substantial loss. We also provide examples of state pairs which can be perfectly distinguished by local measurements if (one-way) classical communication is allowed between the parties, but very poorly without it. Finally, we study how many POVMs are needed to distinguish almost perfectly any pair of states on $\mathbf{C}^d$, showing that the answer is $\exp(\Theta(d^2))$.},

The key advantage of our approach is that it requires far fewer qubits than existing approaches: as a case in point, we show that using as few as $3$ ancilla qubits, one can obtain RUS circuits for approximate multiplication and reciprocals.

  abstract = {Shor's algorithm (SA) is a quantum algorithm for factoring integers. Since SA has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA. Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than classical computers.},

Due to subtle properties of the adiabatic passage, it is possible image an object without interaction between the imaging photons and the sample. The technique can be used on multiple objects in parallel, and is entirely deterministic in the adiabatic limit. Unlike more conventional interaction-free measurement schemes, this adiabatic process is driven by the symmetry of the system, and not by more usual interference effects. As such it provides an interesting alternative quantum protocol which may be applicable to photonic implementations of spatial adiabatic passage. We also show that this scheme can be used to implement a collision-free quantum routing protocol.},

Here we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13.3%, we find that interlinks which attempt entanglement at a rate of 2MHz but suffer 98% photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i.e. rate of high fidelity stabilizer measurements). Improved links would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employed local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices.},

An important quantum optomechanical tool yet to be experimentally demonstrated is the ability to perform complete quantum state reconstruction. Here, after providing a brief introduction to quantum states in phase space, we review and contrast the current proposals for state reconstruction of mechanical motional states and discuss experimental progress. Furthermore, we show that mechanical quadrature tomography using back-action-evading interactions gives an $s$-parameterized Wigner function where the numerical parameter $s$ is directly related to the optomechanical measurement strength.

Here we provide a necessary and sufficient characterization of steering, based on a quantum information processing task: the discrimination of branches in a quantum evolution, which we dub subchannel discrimination. We prove that, for any bipartite steerable state, there are instances of the quantum subchannel discrimination problem for which this state allows a correct discrimination with strictly higher probability than in absence of entanglement, even when measurements are restricted to local measurements aided by one-way communication. On the other hand, unsteerable states are useless in such conditions, even when entangled. We also prove that the above steering advantage can be exactly quantified in terms of the steering robustness, which is a natural measure of the steerability exhibited by the state.},

Because the types of systems differ so widely, we use a case by case approach to identifying the different parameters and criteria that capture their behaviour in a quantum mechanical framework. We find it helpful to categorise systems into three broad classes defined by mass, spatio-temporal coherence, and number of particles. The classes are not mutually exclusive and in fact the properties of some systems fit into several classes. We discuss experiments by turn, starting with interference of massive objects like macromolecules and micro-mechanical resonators, followed by self-interference of single particles in complex molecules, before examining the striking advances made with superconducting qubits. Finally, we propose a theoretical basis for quantifying the macroscopic features of a system to lay the ground for a more systematic comparison of the quantum properties in disparate systems.},

There have been few works focusing on estimating the stock prices of individual companies. However, many of those have worked with very small number of financial parameters. In this work, we apply machine learning techniques to address automated stock picking, while using a larger number of financial parameters for individual companies than the previous studies. Our approaches are based on the supervision of prediction parameters using company fundamentals, time-series properties, and correlation information between different stocks. We examine a variety of supervised learning techniques and found that using stock fundamentals is a useful approach for the classification problem, when combined with the high dimensional data handling capabilities of support vector machine. The portfolio our system suggests by predicting the behavior of stocks results in a 3% larger growth on average than the overall market within a 3-month time period, as the out-of-sample test suggests.},

Recent work by Wood & Spekkens shows that causal models cannot, in general, provide a faithful representation of quantum systems. Since d-separation encodes a form of Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle (RCCP), whose validity is questionable in quantum mechanics, we propose a generalised graph separation rule that does not assume the RCCP. We prove that the new rule faithfully captures the statistical dependencies between observables in a quantum network, encoded as a DAG, and is consistent with d-separation in a classical limit. We note that the resulting model is still unable to give a faithful representation of correlations stronger than quantum mechanics, such as the Popescu-Rorlich box.},

Combining the security bound based on the uncertainty principle with the passive decoy-state protocol, a concise and stringent formula for calculating the key generation rate for QKD using SPDCSs is presented. The simulation shows that the secure distance under our formula can reach up to 182 km when the number of sifted data is $10^{10}$.

We show that the quantum correlations can be advanced by a small fraction of the correlation time while the entanglement is preserved even in the presence of noise added by phase-insensitive gain. Additionally, although we observe an advance of the peak of the quantum mutual information between the modes, we find that the degradation of the mutual information due to the added noise appears to prevent an advancement of the leading edge. In contrast, we show that both the leading and trailing edges of the mutual information in a slow-light system can be significantly delayed.},

Even when finding individual satisfying solutions is computationally easy (e.g. 2-SAT, which is in P), determining the number of solutions is #P-hard. Recently, computational methods simulating quantum systems experienced advancements due to the development of tensor network algorithms and associated quantum physics-inspired techniques. By these methods, we give an algorithm using an axiomatic tensor contraction language for n-variable #SAT instances with complexity $O((g+cd)^{O(1)} 2^c)$ where $c$ is the number of COPY-tensors, $g$ is the number of gates, and $d$ is the maximal degree of any COPY-tensor. Thus, counting problems can be solved efficiently when their tensor network expression has at most $O(\log c)$ COPY-tensors and polynomial fan-out. This framework also admits an intuitive proof of a variant of the Tovey conjecture (the r,1-SAT instance of the Dubois-Tovey theorem). This study increases the theory, expressiveness and application of tensor based algorithmic tools and provides an alternative insight on these problems which have a long history in statistical physics and computer science.},

Here we investigate the even more basic question of whether adiabatic optimization algorithms always succeed in polynomial time for trivial optimization problems in which there are no local energy minima other than the global minimum. Surprisingly, we find a counterexample in which the potential is a single basin on a graph, but the eigenvalue gap is exponentially small as a function of the number of vertices. In this counterexample, the ground state wavefunction consists of two "lobes" separated by a region of exponentially small amplitude. Conversely, we prove if the ground state wavefunction is single-peaked then the eigenvalue gap scales at worst as one over the square of the number of vertices.},

  abstract = {We present the first device-independent quantum cryptography protocol for continuous variables. Our scheme is based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding scheme whereby a qubit is embedded in the infinite-dimensional space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. The novel application of discrete-variable device-independent quantum key distribution to this encoding enables a continuous-variable analogue. Since the security of this protocol is based on discrete-variables we inherit by default security against collective attacks and, under certain memoryless assumptions, coherent attacks. We find that our protocol is valid over the same distances as its discrete-variable counterpart, except that we are able to take advantage of high efficiency commercially available detectors where, for the most part, only homodyne detection is required. This offers the potential of removing the difficulty in closing the loopholes associated with Bell inequalities.},

  abstract = {We introduce a realist, unextravagant interpretation of quantum theory that builds on the existing physical structure of the theory and allows experiments to have definite outcomes, but leaves the theory's basic dynamical content essentially intact. Much as classical systems have specific states that evolve along definite trajectories through configuration spaces, the traditional formulation of quantum theory asserts that closed quantum systems have specific states that evolve unitarily along definite trajectories through Hilbert spaces, and our interpretation extends this intuitive picture of states and Hilbert-space trajectories to the case of open quantum systems as well. We provide independent justification for the partial-trace operation for density matrices, reformulate wave-function collapse in terms of an underlying interpolating dynamics, derive the Born rule from deeper principles, resolve several open questions regarding ontological stability and dynamics, address a number of familiar no-go theorems, and argue that our interpretation is ultimately compatible with Lorentz invariance. Along the way, we also investigate a number of unexplored features of quantum theory, including an interesting geometrical structure---which we call subsystem space---that we believe merits further study. We include an appendix that briefly reviews the traditional Copenhagen interpretation and the measurement problem of quantum theory, as well as the instrumentalist approach and a collection of foundational theorems not otherwise discussed in the main text.},

Here we show that the output probability distribution of the DQC1 model cannot be classically efficiently approximated (exactly within a polynomial bit length or in the fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) with at most a constant error) unless $\mbox{BQP}\subseteq\mbox{BPP}$.},

Accounting for soft information, we show significant improvements in enhanced state detection with the quantum repetition code as well as quantum state or parameter estimation. These advantages persist in spite of non-Gaussian features of realistic readout models, experimentally relevant small numbers of qubits, and finite encoding errors.

As preprocessing of quantum error correction, our scheme estimates the current noise level through a negligible amount of classical computation using error syndromes and updates the decoder's knowledge on the spot before inferring the locations of errors. This preprocessing requires no additional quantum interaction or modification in the system. The estimate can be of higher quality than the maximum likelihood estimate based on perfect knowledge of channel parameters, thereby eliminating the need of the unrealistic assumption that the decoder accurately knows channel parameters a priori. Simulations demonstrate that not only can the decoder pick up on a change of channel parameters, but even if the channel stays the same, a quantum low-density parity-check code can perform better when the decoder exploits the on-the-spot estimates instead of the true error probabilities of the quantum channel.},

  abstract = {The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation - extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for ~60% of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Although the situation appears dire, our analyses suggest that it is far from hopeless: recent initiatives by the scientific community -- including policy changes by journals and funding agencies -- are improving the state of affairs.},

Here we develop a quantum circuits version of time-reversal symmetry theory, classifying time-symmetric and time-asymmetric Hamiltonians and circuits in terms of their underlying network elements and geometric structures. These results reveal that many of the typical quantum circuit networks found across the field of quantum information science exhibit time-asymmetry. We then experimentally implement the most fundamental time-reversal asymmetric process, applying local gates in an otherwise time-symmetric circuit to induce time-reversal asymmetry and thereby achieve (i) directional biasing in the transition probability between basis states, (ii) the enhancement of and (iii) the suppression of these transport probabilities. Our results imply that the physical effect of time-symmetry breaking plays an essential role in coherent transport and its control represents an omnipresent yet essentially untapped resource in quantum transport science.},

A useful duality exists between post-selected ensembles and a consistent picture of acausal physics embodying the application of Novikov's consistency postulate to the wave-function of a time machine. A competing view applies this postulate to density matrices instead, but that lies outside the scope of this paper. To find out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a weighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such that each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a particular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part of the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times. In the dual post-selection picture the weight is simply the probability for the 'periodic bit' to satisfy the constraint, plus a small noise part, often assumed constant, representing the error rate of the time machine's channel. The emerging bit is one of a Bell pair, its partner kept in reserve to test that the bit entering the time machine later matches the one which emerged. This is done by interfering the incoming bit with the reserve member of the pair and keeping the experimental runs that interfere constructively. Noise can be effectively simulated by keeping a small proportion of runs that interfere destructively, or by perturbing the reserve bit to decohere it by a similar amount. Paradoxes remain but are tractable.},

  abstract = {The concepts of quantum correlation complexity and quantum communication complexity were recently proposed to quantify the minimum amount of resources needed in generating bipartite classical or quantum states in the single-shot setting. The former is the minimum size of the initially shared state $\sigma$ on which local operations by the two parties (without communication) can generate the target state $\rho$, and the latter is the minimum amount of communication needed when initially sharing nothing. In this paper, we generalize these two concepts to multipartite cases, for both exact and approximate state generation. Our results are summarized as follows. (1) For multipartite pure states, the correlation complexity can be completely characterized by local ranks of sybsystems. (2) We extend the notion of PSD-rank of matrices to that of tensors, and use it to bound the quantum correlation complexity for generating multipartite classical distributions. (3) For generating multipartite mixed quantum states, communication complexity is not always equal to correlation complexity (as opposed to bipartite case). But they differ by at most a factor of 2. Generating a multipartite mixed quantum state has the same communication complexity as generating its optimal purification. But for correlation complexity of these two tasks can be different (though still related by less than a factor of 2). (4) To generate a bipartite classical distribution $P(x,y)$ approximately, the quantum communication complexity is completely characterized by the approximate PSD-rank of $P$. The quantum correlation complexity of approximately generating multipartite pure states is bounded by approximate local ranks.},

We also demonstrate that the optimality of the algorithm breaks down when losses are taken into account, in which case the performance is inferior to the optimal entanglement-based estimation strategies. Finally, we show that when an alternative resource quantification is adopted, which describes the phase estimation in Shor's algorithm more accurately, the standard Kitaev's procedure is indeed optimal and there is no need to consider its generalized version.},

Schwemmer et al. (arXiv:1310.8465 [quant-ph]) illustrate this by observing a systematic underestimation of the fidelity and an overestimation of entanglement in estimators obtained from simulated data. Further, these authors argue that the simple method of linear inversion overcomes this (perceived) problem of bias, and there is the suggestion to abandon time-tested estimation procedures in favor of linear inversion. Here, we discuss the pros and cons of using biased and unbiased estimators for quantum state tomography. We conclude that the little occasional benefit from the unbiased linear-inversion estimation does not justify the high price of using unphysical estimators, which are typically the case in that scheme.},

  abstract = {Detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement of a given unknown state poses problems that are fundamentally important for quantum information processing. Surprisingly, no direct (i.e., without quantum tomography) universal experimental implementation of a necessary and sufficient test of entanglement has been designed even for a general two-qubit state. Here we propose an experimental method for detecting a collective universal witness, which is a necessary and sufficient test of two-photon polarization entanglement. It allows us to detect entanglement for any two-qubit mixed state, and to establish tight upper and lower bounds on its amount. A novel element of this method is the sequential character of its main components, which allows us to obtain relatively complicated information about quantum correlations with the help of simple linear-optical elements. As such, this proposal is the first to realize a universal two-qubit entanglement test within the present state of the art of quantum optics. We show the optimality of our setup with respect to the minimal number of measured quantities.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of information expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible - i.e. in constructor-theoretic terms. Although it includes conjectured laws of physics that are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, it does not regard information as an a priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. It does not suffer from the circularity at the foundations of existing information theory (namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other). It explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning, the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and unpredictable, the irreducible perturbation caused by measurement, and entanglement (locally inaccessible information).},

To this end we show that Bogoliubov modes can be described by a time rescaling of the Minkowski metric. A consequence of this is that Rindler transformations are perceived by the phonons as generalised Rindler transformations where the speed of light is replaced by the speed of sound, enhancing particle creation at small velocities. Since the non-relativistic limit of a Rindler transformation is just a Galilean transformation entailing no length contraction or time dilation, we show that the effect vanishes in the non-relativistic limit.},

  abstract = {Quantum metrology uses quantum states with no classical counterpart to measure a physical quantity with extraordinary sensitivity or precision. Most metrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing it with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme usually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family. If this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one parameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme case, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This requires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete set of probe states. It is very convenient if this set is group-covariant -- i.e., each element is generated by applying an element of the quantum system's natural symmetry group to a single fixed fiducial state. In this paper, we consider metrology with 2-photon ("biphoton") states, and report experimental studies of different states' sensitivity to small, unknown collective SU(2) rotations ("SU(2) jitter"). Maximally entangled N00N states are the most sensitive detectors of such a rotation, yet they are also among the worst at fully characterizing an a-priori unknown process. We identify (and confirm experimentally) the best SU(2)-covariant set for process tomography; these states are all less entangled than the N00N state, and are characterized by the fact that they form a 2-design.},

  abstract = {Alice and Bob receive a bipartite state (possibly entangled) from some finite collection or from some subspace. Alice sends a message to Bob through a noisy quantum channel such that Bob may determine the initial state, with zero chance of error. This framework encompasses, for example, teleportation, dense coding, entanglement assisted quantum channel capacity, and one-way communication complexity of function evaluation. With classical sources and channels, this problem can be analyzed using graph homomorphisms. We show this quantum version can be analyzed using homomorphisms on non-commutative graphs (an operator space generalization of graphs). Previously the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$ number has been generalized to non-commutative graphs; we show this to be a homomorphism monotone, thus providing bounds on quantum source-channel coding. We generalize the Schrijver and Szegedy numbers, and show these to be monotones as well. As an application we construct a quantum channel whose entanglement assisted zero-error one-shot capacity can only be unlocked by using a non-maximally entangled state. These homomorphisms allow definition of a chromatic number for non-commutative graphs. Many open questions are presented regarding the possibility of a more fully developed theory.},

First we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with spin squeezed states, with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, Dicke states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the the speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological tasks.},

  abstract = {The accelerated development of quantum technology has reached a pivotal point. Early in 2014, several results were published demonstrating that several experimental technologies are now accurate enough to satisfy the requirements of fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. While there are many technological and experimental issues that still need to be solved, the ability of experimental systems to now have error rates low enough to satisfy the fault-tolerant threshold for several error correction models is a tremendous milestone. Consequently, it is now a good time for the computer science and classical engineering community to examine the {\em classical} problems associated with compiling quantum algorithms and implementing them on future quantum hardware. In this paper, we will review the basic operational rules of a topological quantum computing architecture and outline one of the most important classical problems that need to be solved; the decoding of error correction data for a large-scale quantum computer. We will endeavour to present these problems independently from the underlying physics as much of this work can be effectively solved by non-experts in quantum information or quantum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Adiabatic transport provides a powerful way to manipulate quantum states. By preparing a system in a readily initialised state and then slowly changing its Hamiltonian, one may achieve quantum states that would otherwise be inaccessible. Moreover, a judicious choice of final Hamiltonian whose groundstate encodes the solution to a problem allows adiabatic transport to be used for universal quantum computation. However, the dephasing effects of the environment limit the quantum correlations that an open system can support and degrade the power of such adiabatic computation. We quantify this effect by allowing the system to evolve over a restricted set of quantum states, providing a link between physically inspired classical optimisation algorithms and quantum adiabatic optimisation. This new perspective allows us to develop benchmarks to bound the quantum correlations harnessed by an adiabatic computation. We apply these to the D-Wave Vesuvius machine with revealing - though inconclusive - results.},

This problem has been introduced and investigated by Colnaghi et al. where two models of computations are considered. This first is the (standard) model of query complexity: the complexity measure is the number of calls to any of the unitary gates $U_i$ in a quantum circuit which solves the problem. The second model provides quantum switches and treats unitary transformations as inputs of second order. In that case the complexity measure is the number of quantum switches. In their paper, Colnaghi et al. have shown that the problem can be solved within $n^2$ calls in the query model and $\frac{n(n-1)}2$ quantum switches in the new model. We refine these results by proving that $n\log_2(n) +\Theta(n)$ quantum switches are necessary and sufficient to solve this problem, whereas $n^2-2n+4$ calls are sufficient to solve this problem in the standard quantum circuit model. We prove, with an additional assumption on the family of gates used in the circuits, that $n^2-o(n^{7/4+\epsilon})$ queries are required, for any $\epsilon >0$. The upper and lower bounds for the standard quantum circuit model are established by pointing out connections with the permutation as substring problem introduced by Karp.},

This reduction however requires a special noise model with independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors. Secondly, we show how to implement MLD approximately for more general noise models using matrix product states (MPS). Our implementation has running time $O(n\chi^3)$ where $\chi$ is a parameter that controls the approximation precision. The key step of our algorithm, borrowed from the DMRG method, is a subroutine for contracting a tensor network on the two-dimensional grid. The subroutine uses MPS with a bond dimension $\chi$ to approximate the sequence of tensors arising in the course of contraction. We benchmark the MPS-based decoder against the standard minimum weight matching decoder observing a significant reduction of the logical error probability for $\chi\ge 4$.},

  abstract = {Quantum entanglement plays a central role in many areas of physics, from quantum information science to many-body systems. In order to grasp the essence of this phenomenon, it is fundamental to understand how different manifestations of entanglement relate to each other. In 1999, Peres conjectured that Bell nonlocality is equivalent to distillability of entanglement. The intuition of Peres was that the non-classicality of an entangled state, as witnessed via Bell inequality violation, implies that pure entanglement can be distilled from this state, hence making it useful for most quantum information protocols. Subsequently, the Peres conjecture was shown to hold true in several specific cases, and became a central open question in quantum information theory. Here we disprove the Peres conjecture by showing that an undistillable bipartite entangled state---a bound entangled state---can nevertheless violate a Bell inequality. This shows that Bell nonlocality implies neither entanglement distillability, nor non-positivity under partial transposition, thus clarifying the relation between three fundamental aspects of entanglement. Finally, our results lead to a novel application of bound entanglement for device-independent randomness certification.},

  abstract = {Recently, the longstanding Gaussian optimizer conjecture was proven for bosonic Gaussian gauge-covariant or contravariant channels in the work of Giovannetti, Holevo and Garcia-Patron [3]. In the paper of Mari, Giovannetti and Holevo [11] this result was strengthened for one-mode channels by establishing that the output for the vacuum or coherent input majorizes the output for any other input. In the present paper we give the multimode extension of the result of [11], including sufficient conditions under which the coherent states are the only optimizers. We also discuss direct implications of this multimode majorization result to the positive solution of the additivity problem for the Gaussian channels. In particular, we demonstrate the additivity of the output Renyi entropies of arbitrary order p>1. Finally, we present an alternative derivation of a majorization property of Glauber's coherent states by Lieb and Solovej [10], basing on the method of the work [3].},

This type of signalling is related to Casimir-like interactions and it is made possible by dimension ---and curvature--- dependent subtleties of Huygens' principle.},

  abstract = {We investigate entanglement purification protocols based on hashing, where a large number of noisy entangled pairs is jointly processed to obtain a reduced number of perfect, noiseless copies. While hashing and breeding protocols are the only purification protocols that asymptotically obtain a nonzero yield, they are not applicable in a realistic scenario if local gates and measurements are imperfect. We show that such problems can be overcome by a compact measurement-based implementation, yielding entanglement purification schemes with nonzero yield that are applicable also in noisy scenarios, with tolerable noise per particle of several percent. We also generalize these findings to multiparty purification protocols for arbitrary graph states.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a method for investigating semi-device-independent randomness expansion protocols that was introduced in [Li et al., Phys. Rev. A $\mathbf{87}$, 020302(R) (2013)]. This method allows to lower-bound, with semi-definite programming, the randomness obtained from random number generators based on dimension witnesses. We also investigate the robustness of some randomness expanders using this method. We show the role of an assumption about the trace of the measurement operators and a way to avoid it. The method is also generalized to systems of arbitrary dimension, and for a more general form of dimension witnesses, than it the previous paper. Finally, we introduce a procedure of dimension witness reduction, which can be used to obtain from an existing witness a new one with higher amount of certifiable randomness. The presented methods finds an application for experiments [Ahrens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{112}$, 140401 (2014)].},

  abstract = {A `process theory' is any theory of systems and processes which admits sequential and parallel composition. `Terminality' unifies normalisation of pure states, trace-preservation of CP-maps, and adding up to identity of positive operators in quantum theory, and generalises this to arbitrary process theories. We show that terminality and non-signalling coincide in any process theory, provided one makes causal structure explicit. In fact, making causal structure explicit is necessary to even make sense of non-signalling in process theories. We conclude that because of its much simpler mathematical form, terminality should be taken to be a more fundamental notion than non-signalling.},

This anonymity is a manifestation of the impossibility to attribute unambiguously the underlying multipartite nonlocality to any definite subset(s) of the parties, even though the correlation can indeed be produced by nonlocal collaboration involving only such subsets. An explicit biseparable decomposition of these correlations is provided for any partitioning of the $n$ parties into two groups. Two possible applications of these anonymous GHZ correlations in the device-independent setting are discussed: multipartite secret sharing between any two groups of parties and bipartite quantum key distribution that is robust against nearly arbitrary leakage of information.},

  abstract = {The suggestion that particles of the same kind may be indistinguishable in a fundamental sense, even so that challenges to traditional notions of individuality and identity may arise, has first come up in the context of classical statistical mechanics. In particular, the Gibbs paradox has sometimes been interpreted as a sign of the untenability of the classical concept of a particle and as a premonition that quantum theory is needed. This idea of a quantum connection stubbornly persists in the literature, even though it has also been criticized frequently. Here we shall argue that although this criticism is justified, the proposed alternative solutions have often been wrong and have not put the paradox in its right perspective. In fact, the Gibbs paradox is unrelated to fundamental issues of particle identity; only distinguishability in a pragmatic sense plays a role (in this we develop ideas of van Kampen [10]), and in principle the paradox always is there as long as the concept of a particle applies at all. In line with this we show that the paradox survives even in quantum mechanics, in spite of the quantum mechanical (anti-)symmetrization postulates.},

  abstract = {It is proposed to give up the description of physical states in terms of ensembles of state vectors with various probabilities, relying instead solely on the density matrix as the description of reality. With this definition of a physical state, even in entangled states nothing that is done in one isolated system can instantaneously effect the physical state of a distant isolated system. This change in the description of physical states opens up a large variety of new ways that the density matrix may transform under various symmetries, different from the unitary transformations of ordinary quantum mechanics. Such new transformation properties have been explored before, but so far only for the symmetry of time translations into the future, treated as a semi-group. Here new transformation properties are studied for general symmetry transformations forming groups, rather than semi-groups. Arguments are given that such symmetries should act on the density matrix as in ordinary quantum mechanics, but loopholes are found for all of these arguments.},

  abstract = {Quantum thermodynamics is a research field that aims at fleshing out the ultimate limits of thermodynamic processes in the deep quantum regime. A complete picture of quantum thermodynamics allows for catalysts, i.e., systems facilitating state transformations while remaining essentially intact in their state, very much reminding of catalysts in chemical reactions. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the power and limitation of such thermal catalysis. Specifically, we provide a family of optimal catalysts that can be returned with minimal trace distance error after facilitating a state transformation process. To incorporate the genuine physical role of a catalyst, we identify very significant restrictions on arbitrary state transformations under dimension or mean energy bounds, using methods of convex relaxations. We discuss the implication of these findings on possible thermodynamic state transformations in the quantum regime.},

But due to their high computational cost, developing and improving PEPS algorithms is necessary to make the ansatz widely usable in practice. Here we analyze several algorithmic aspects of the method. On the one hand, we quantify the connection between the correlation length of the PEPS and the accuracy of its approximate contraction, and discuss how purifications can be used in the latter. On the other, we present algorithmic improvements for the update of the tensor that introduce drastic gains in the numerical conditioning and the efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the state-of-the-art general PEPS code is benchmarked with the Heisenberg and quantum Ising models on lattices of up to $21 \times 21$ sites.},
